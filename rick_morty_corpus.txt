I got a surprise for you.<br/> Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard.<br/> I got a surprise for you, Morty.<br/> What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage.<br/> Yeah, Rick, it's great.<br/> - Is this the surprise? - Morty, I had to I had to I had to I had to make a bomb, Morty.<br/> - I had to create a bomb.<br/> - What?! A bomb?! We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty.<br/> - Create a whole fresh start.<br/> - T-t-that's absolutely crazy! Come on, Morty.<br/> Just take it easy, Morty.<br/> It's gonna be good.<br/> Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.<br/> Jessica? From my math class? When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.<br/> And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and so that's the surprise, Morty.<br/> No, you can't! Jessica doesn't even know I exist.<br/> But but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity.<br/> I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty.<br/> Listen, I'm not you don't you don't got to worry about me trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything.<br/> I'm I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.<br/> What are you talking about, Rick? You you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything.<br/> She she she she she's all for you, Morty.<br/> I don't care about Jessica! You know what, Morty? You're right.<br/> Let's forget the girl all together.<br/> She she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.<br/> Arming neutrino bomb.<br/> That's it that's it, Rick.<br/> I'm taking the wheel.<br/> Get off of me, Morty! I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy.<br/> What's gotten into you?

That was all a test, Morty.<br/> Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.<br/> It was? Sure.<br/> Why not? I don't know.<br/> You you know what, mo- Neutrino bomb armed.<br/> Um Corrections by XhmikosR I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight.<br/> Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer? Oh, my God.<br/> His head is in his food.<br/> - I'm going to puke.<br/> - Morty, are you getting sick? I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room pillow.<br/> The dog sleeps on it.<br/> I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom.<br/> I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.<br/> Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.<br/> Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick.<br/> - What?! - Dad? What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time? Damn it! - Jerry! - Beth! Oh, my God.<br/> My parents are so loud.<br/> I want to die.<br/> Mm, there is no God, summer.<br/> You got to rip that band-aid off now.<br/> You'll thank me later.<br/> Okay, with all due respect, Rick What am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole? Listen, Jerry, I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything.<br/> It's your house.<br/> It's your world.<br/> You're a real Julius Caesar.<br/> But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry.<br/> It's a waste of time a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other.<br/> G-guy up front says, ""two plus two.<br/>"" The people in the back say, ""four.<br/>"" Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something.<br/> I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry.<br/> And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.<br/> This was a good breakfast, Beth.<br/> You really made the crap out of those eggs.<br/> I wish your mother was here to eat them.<br/> Oh, dad.<br/> What? For real? All right, now, everybody get settled.<br/> Get away from the windows! Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today.<br/> You might have heard of it.<br/> It's called math.<br/> And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in.<br/> - Two plus two.<br/> - Jessica.<br/> Five plus five.<br/> Tenssica.<br/> Okay, good.<br/> It's time for the quiz.<br/> Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough!

Hi, Jessica.<br/> Can I show these to you? Wow.<br/> Th-they're both great.<br/> Thank you.<br/> You know what I named these? My little morties.<br/> Uh, that's flattering and a little weird.<br/> Do you know what I want you to do with them? Rename them? Squeeze them.<br/> Manhandle them.<br/> Give them the business.<br/> See if you can shuffle them.<br/> I mean, really get in there and knock them around.<br/> - No wrong answers.<br/> - Wow.<br/> Well, okay, Jessica.<br/> L-let's give this a shot.<br/> Mm.<br/> Oh, Morty.<br/> What are you doing to me? Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.<br/> Morty! What are you doing to me?! Jessica.<br/> Morty! Jessica.<br/> Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad.<br/> Je-Jessica.<br/> Jessica.<br/> Not my fault this is happening.<br/> Well, well, well.<br/> - Uh, morning, Frank.<br/> - ""Morning""? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family's poor? Oh, geez, Frank.<br/> I don't know if a knife is necessary.<br/> I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.<br/> You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty.<br/> And now I'm gonna cut you, 'cause my family's rich.<br/> There you are, Morty.<br/> Listen to me.<br/> I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension.<br/> I need an extra pair of hands.<br/> Oh, geez, Rick.<br/> What'd you do to Frank? It's pretty obvious, Morty.<br/> I froze him.<br/> Now listen I need your help, Morty.<br/> I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.<br/> - It's important.<br/> Come on, Morty.<br/> - I don't know, Rick.<br/> I can't leave school again.<br/> Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on! Aw, geez.<br/> Okay.<br/> I guess I can skip history.<br/> What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him? I'll do it later, Morty.<br/> He'll be fine.<br/> Let's go.<br/> Oh, my God.<br/> I'm about to walk past Frank Palicky.<br/> This is the story we'll be telling our children.<br/> Hi, Frank.<br/> Aah! - Scalpel.<br/> - Scalpel.<br/> Knock, knock.<br/> Jerry? My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, ""hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"" We're losing him.<br/> Okay, he's back.<br/> Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason.<br/> Well, it's lunch.<br/> I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia.<br/> Losing him.<br/> Stabilized.<br/> Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.<br/> - Well, yeah, on horses.<br/> - Excuse me? Okay.<br/> Let's not rehash that fight.<br/> I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way.<br/> Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home.<br/> Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here.<br/> Let's put your dad in a nursing home.<br/> We're losing him.<br/> Hey, Tom.<br/> We know when we're losing him.<br/> We can hear the beeps! There she is.<br/> All right.<br/> Come on, Morty.<br/> Let's go.<br/> Oh, geez.<br/> Okay.<br/> Oh, man, Rick.<br/> What is this place? It's dimension 35c, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a mega tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits.<br/> I'm talking about mega seeds.<br/> They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.<br/> Oh, man, Rick.<br/> I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.<br/> All right.<br/> All right.<br/> Calm down.<br/> Listen to me, Morty.<br/> I know that new situations can be intimidating.<br/> You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people.<br/> I'm no stranger to scary situations.<br/> I deal with them all the time.<br/> Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be holy crap, Morty, run! I never seen that thing before in my life.<br/> I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty! Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.<br/> Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty.<br/> Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty.<br/> That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline.<br/> All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now? Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us.<br/> Look at that thing right there.<br/> What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school? Look at it just lumbering around.<br/> It defies all logic that thing.<br/> Yeah, Rick, I get it.<br/> We're surrounded by monsters.<br/> That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.<br/> Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.<br/> Morty, you see this? You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there? The mega trees? That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them.<br/> And that's what I'm talking about, Morty.<br/> That's where my seeds are.<br/> If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school.<br/> All right, all right.<br/> So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways? You ask a lot of questions, Morty.<br/> Not very charismatic.<br/> It makes you kind of an Under underfoot figure.<br/> Just take these shoes, Morty.<br/> They're special grappling shoes.<br/> When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left.<br/> These things really bring it all together.<br/> Aah! You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on! I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's secret? I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's day.<br/> More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.<br/> Everything cool in here, Beth? - It's fine, Davin.<br/> - Okay, cool.<br/> You know, we did something great today.<br/> There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.<br/> Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.<br/> Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.<br/> Well, maybe you're right.<br/> Uh, yeah, maybe I am.<br/> I'm my father's daughter.<br/> I'm smart.<br/> Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon? Horse heart surgeon.<br/> Hello? Mrs.<br/> Smith? This is principal Vagina, no relation.<br/> I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon? Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on your legs right now.<br/> You know, you got to turn the shoes on, Morty, for them to work.<br/> Yeah, look I turned mine on.<br/> I had no problem getting down here.<br/> It was a leisurely breeze.<br/> I'm in a lot of pain, Rick.<br/> Yeah, I can see that.<br/> But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty? Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster.<br/> Y-you're like Hitler, but but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.<br/> Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.<br/> Ooh.<br/> Ohh.<br/> Ooh.<br/> Wow, Rick.<br/> That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly.<br/> I mean, I've never felt so good in my life.<br/> Thank you.<br/> Don't worry about it, Morty.<br/> Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy? Sure thing, Rick.<br/> Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.<br/> The stuff was all over the place, Morty.<br/> Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.<br/> There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up.<br/> The dimension I visited was so advanced, they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever.<br/> I was the only old person there, Morty.<br/> It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around.<br/> I-I was fascinating to them.<br/> There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me.<br/> I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty.<br/> - It's got no charge left.<br/> - What?! It's as good as garbage, Morty.<br/> It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.<br/> Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.<br/> W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now.<br/> How are we gonna get back home? There's ways to get back home, Morty.<br/> It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle.<br/> We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.<br/> Uh-oh.<br/> When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.<br/> In my butt? Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.<br/> Oh, geez, Rick.<br/> I really don't want to have to do that.<br/> Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty.<br/> Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty.<br/> And they'll fall right out of mine.<br/> I've done this too many times, Morty.<br/> I mean, you're young.<br/> You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable.<br/> You got to do it for grandpa, Morty.<br/> Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.<br/> - In my butt? - Come on, Morty.<br/> Please, Morty.<br/> You have to do it, Morty.<br/> Oh, man.<br/> The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.<br/> What? Why didn't you notify us? I done been notifying you.<br/> Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather? Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating? Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.<br/> Summer? What kind of God lets this happen? We had a little incident.<br/> A student was frozen to death.<br/> And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place.<br/> I won't let them.<br/> The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.<br/> So, I told him, ""give me the blimfarx,"" you know? This this guy he doesn't understand interstellar currency.<br/> It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like, that's what we eat on girvonesk.<br/> The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.<br/> I don't like it here, Morty.<br/> I can't abide bureaucracy.<br/> I don't like being told where to go and what to do.<br/> I consider it a violation.<br/> Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? Yeah, Rick.<br/> Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy.<br/> They hurt.<br/> That means they're good ones.<br/> You're a good kid, Morty.<br/> Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work.<br/> You've been a huge help to me.<br/> I'm gonna be able to do all kind of things with them.<br/> It's gonna be great, Morty.<br/> All kinds of science.<br/> Okay, next through.<br/> Except you.<br/> You go over there.<br/> Why does he have to go over there? Random check.<br/> He's got to go through the new machine.<br/> What new machine? It's a new machine.<br/> It detects stuff all the way up your butt.<br/> Run, Morty! Run! Aah! Red alert! Ohhhhh! Hey! Ohhhhhh.<br/> Aah! Don't think about it! Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.<br/> Whoooooo! Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg.<br/> You know me I'm just trying to- Aah! I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty.<br/> - Cover me.<br/> - Oh, man.<br/> I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.<br/> They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots! Aah! My leg is shot off! Glenn's bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children! They're not robots, Rick! It's a figure of speech, Morty.<br/> They're bureaucrats.<br/> I don't respect them.<br/> Just keep shooting, Morty.<br/> You have no idea what prison is like here! Holy crap! This is insane! Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here! Wow.<br/> Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal? Uh, yeah.<br/> Well, you know, my my Ferrari's in the shop.<br/> Just kidding.<br/> - You're Morty, right? - Yeah.<br/> You can get his number later.<br/> Come on, Morty.<br/> We got to get out of here.<br/> You got to get those seeds out of your ass.<br/> Oh, look, honey.<br/> It's our son with Albert Ein-douche.<br/> What? I'm an angry father, not an improvisor.<br/> Oh, hi, Jerry.<br/> Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this.<br/> Your your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior.<br/> No? No takers? You guys should really not be touching that stuff.<br/> - It's beyond your reasoning.<br/> - You're beyond our reasoning! Takes one to know one.<br/> Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl.<br/> He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.<br/> What what are you guys doing with my stuff? We're moving you to a nursing home.<br/> A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius.<br/> I build robots for fun.<br/> Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas.<br/> - What does that mean? - It's personal.<br/> Dad, mom, come on.<br/> Rick just needed my help is all.<br/> Morty, stay out of this.<br/> You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.<br/> What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something? Oh, don't high-road us, dad.<br/> You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.<br/> I-I-I don't know what you mean by that.<br/> Can can can you be a little bit more specific? Oh, for crying out he's got some kind of disability or something.<br/> Is that what you want us to say? I do? Well, duh doy, son.<br/> Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.<br/> Aw, geez, dad.<br/> Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.<br/> Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.<br/> Oh, come on, Rick.<br/> You know I can't.<br/> The square root of pi, Morty.<br/> Go! Whoa! What the hell? Holy crap.<br/> He's right.<br/> Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.<br/> ""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system.<br/>"" Wow! I'm so smart! But I told the both of you school is stupid.<br/> It's not how you learn things.<br/> Morty's a gifted child.<br/> He has a special mind.<br/> That's why he's my little helper.<br/> He's like me.<br/> He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life.<br/> He's too smart for school.<br/> He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.<br/> Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.<br/> No, I-I understand.<br/> Uh, maybe we overreacted.<br/> But he has to keep going to school.<br/> Okay, Jerry.<br/> You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You you really wear the pants around here.<br/> I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication.<br/> Frank Palicky was frozen to death today! No idea what you're talking about.<br/> Okay.<br/> Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour.<br/> Don't stay up all night again.<br/> This is good, though.<br/> This can work.<br/> I think we can be a family.<br/> And now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.<br/> You know what? Okay.<br/> Holy cow, Rick.<br/> I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.<br/> Full disclosure, Morty it's not.<br/> Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.<br/> Aw, man.<br/> Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.<br/> Starting right about now.<br/> Ohh, man.<br/> Oh, geez! Ohh.<br/> I'm sorry, Morty.<br/> It's a bummer.<br/> In reality, you're as dumb as they come.<br/> And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more.<br/> And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty.<br/> And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty.<br/> But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty.<br/> We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty.<br/> Just you and me, Morty.<br/> The outside world is our enemy, Morty.<br/> We're the only friends we've got, Morty.<br/> It's just Rick and Morty.<br/> Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty.<br/> Rick and Morty forever and forever.<br/> Morty's things.<br/> Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time.<br/> All day long, forever.<br/> All a hundred days.<br/> Rick and Morty forever 100 times.<br/> Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.<br/>com.<br/> All 100 years.<br/> Every minute, rickandmorty.<br/>com.<br/> Corrections by XhmikosR   <br/>

Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen.<br/> And because I have a human shield.<br/> Mrs.<br/> Pancakes! Oh, no, Morty.<br/> His subconscious is panicking.<br/> Run! Relax, Morty.<br/> Look! Mrs.<br/> Pancakes has a parachute.<br/> Come on! Hey, you don't know me! Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs.<br/> Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava! - Pretty concise, Morty.<br/> Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable.<br/> That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs.<br/> Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty.<br/> That'll buy us some time to figure this out! You don't know m- All right, let's go.<br/> Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.<br/> Don't judge, Morty.<br/> Okay.<br/> All right, well Look, Mrs.<br/> Pancakes is right over there.<br/> I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.<br/> Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea.<br/> Listen to me.<br/> If we're gonna incept Mrs.<br/> Pancakes, we have to blend.<br/> I'll talk to you after lunch.<br/> Ooh, hey! Ooh, oh! Oh, man.<br/> Come and join us.<br/> I'm sorry.<br/> No, no.<br/> - Ooh, come here! - No, thanks! Ooh, wow! - Come over here, baby! - No, I'm okay.<br/> Whoa! Summer?! Hey, there, stranger.<br/> What do you think of these things? Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.<br/> It's Summer! Aw, geez.<br/> Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.<br/> Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy.<br/> Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.<br/> Oh, my God.<br/> Oh, my God! Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake! This is disgusting! - I'm gonna puke! - I can't take it, Rick! Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death! Off with their heads! Time to go another dream deep, Morty! What the hell? Why would Mr.<br/> goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.<br/> Pancakes' dream version of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick? Geez, I don't know, Morty.<br/> Wha-what do you want from me? Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! - Oh, here we go! - Holy crap! Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.<br/> I'm scary Terry.<br/> You can run, but you can't hide, bitch! Whoa! Hey, buddy.<br/> What you got going on there? Snuffles fix.<br/> Make better.<br/> Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome! Snuffles want to be understood.<br/> Snuffles need to be understood.<br/> Okay, yeah.<br/> I get what Beth was talking about.<br/> Fun's over.<br/> Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.<br/> - Why not? - I don't know.<br/> It's Indian giving.<br/> A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill.<br/> It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy.<br/> Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV.<br/> ""A,"" ""b"" his name is scary Terry ""C,"" ""d"" he's very scary Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty! Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man! ""E,"" ""f"" he'll design your death The little girl! Huh? ""J,"" ""k,"" he'll really ruin your day Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.<br/> Oh, geez, Rick.<br/> W-w-whoa, this isn't good.<br/> Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch! Ohhhh! Holy crap, Morty.<br/> He can travel through dreams.<br/> He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed! Where are my testicles, Summer? Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed.<br/> Where have they gone? Oh, wow.<br/> That's an intense line of questioning, snuffles.<br/> Do not call me that! ""Snuffles"" was my slave name.<br/> You shall now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.<br/> Okay, snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me.<br/> Scaring you? Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund? Uhhh Hey.<br/> Oh, wow.<br/> Okay, is is is everything okay in here? Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again? No! No, we were uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to uh Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks! Yeah.<br/> Totally.<br/> Let's go.<br/> You will walk when it is time to walk.<br/> What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept me to get an ""A"" in math? Oh, yeah.<br/> Buckle up, bitch! Man, he sure says ""bitch"" a lot! You can run, but you can't hide, bitch! Hold on, Morty.<br/> Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide.<br/> - I say we try hiding.<br/> - But that's the opposite of what- Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything? Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick.<br/> Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.<br/> Worst-case scenario we're back to running.<br/> Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time.<br/> Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.<br/> Thanks, Morty.<br/> Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.<br/> You can run But you can't hide! Oh, this is perfect, Morty.<br/> Look at that.<br/> He's getting sleepy.<br/> Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day.<br/> That's when we make our move.<br/> Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding.<br/> Dad, he wants to be called snowball.<br/> Well, I'm not calling him that.<br/> That's ridiculous.<br/> You're being very aggressive, Jerry.<br/> Perhaps tomorrow Dr.<br/> scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.<br/> You think you can control me with a haircut? Hi, honey.<br/> You're home early.<br/> - How was your day? - I don't want to talk about it! Oh, of course.<br/> - You never want to talk about it.<br/> - Get off my back, bitch! Out there.<br/> Not in here.<br/> Yeah, I know, I know.<br/> I shouldn't take my anger out on you or scary Brandon.<br/> I love you, Melissa.<br/> I love you, too, Terry.<br/> Morty, this is perfect.<br/> After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.<br/> Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.<br/> Oh, boy, Rick.<br/> I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare scary Terry.<br/> Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants! Ah, well, Mr.<br/> Terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch? Oh um ""Bitch.<br/>"" Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch? Hey, leave him alone! Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap.<br/> Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants? Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this.<br/> You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry.<br/> You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.<br/> Hey, yo, scary T.<br/>, don't even trip about your pants dawg.<br/> Here's a pair on us, fool.<br/> Aww, bitch.<br/> I don't know what to say.<br/> You don't need to say anything.<br/> We got you, dawg.<br/> You're our boy, dawg.<br/> Don't even trip.<br/> Oh, hey, it's you guys! I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.<br/> If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.<br/> As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.<br/> ""Q,"" ""r,"" you won't get very far I always hated that song! These halves don't belong together, bitch! Sex is sacred! This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch! Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm giving Morty an ""A"" in math, and that's my idea.<br/> That is an original thought.<br/> What the hell? Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty? Oh, man, what's going on? Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.<br/> I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.<br/> This is why I choose to get C's.<br/> Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.<br/> - Dad! - Rick! - Oh, thank God, Morty.<br/> - Oh, you're welcome.<br/> All right, let's get out of here.<br/> If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.<br/> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br/> We're not going anywhere.<br/> This is my house.<br/> I'm not abandoning it.<br/> It's all over, Jerry.<br/> The dogs are on a path to total world domination.<br/> But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right? Wait a minute.<br/> I have an idea.<br/> Gentlemen, a moment of your time.<br/> See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns.<br/> That means I own them.<br/> Bad person.<br/> Bad.<br/> Ooh, great plan, Jerry.<br/> Bring the boy to me.<br/> You were always kind to me, Morty.<br/> That's why I will leave you with your testicles.<br/> From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side.<br/> Th-thanks, snuffles.<br/> Begin phase two.<br/> Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard.<br/> It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end.<br/> Please! Please don't kill me! What's she saying, bill? I think she's saying, ""I love lasagna.<br/>"" Mmm.<br/> Thank you, Fido.<br/> Rick! I thought you were dead! No, no, no, I was just playing dead.<br/> Good news, though, Morty.<br/> This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.<br/> - What? - It's a dream, Morty.<br/> We're in your dog's dream.<br/> The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep.<br/> Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.<br/> But I-it's been like a whole year! It's been six hours.<br/> Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time.<br/> So, you know, every day here is like a minute.<br/> It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.<br/> Aw, man.<br/> I really liked this life.<br/> Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.<br/> No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty.<br/> You're sleeping in your crap right now.<br/> Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants.<br/> I mean, it's a mess out there.<br/> I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.<br/> Aw, man, geez! Seriously? Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty.<br/> Here, here take these, Morty.<br/> Take these.<br/> Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something? Close.<br/> It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.<br/> What?! It's necessary for the plan, Morty.<br/> Don't even trip, dawg.<br/> It's pretty bad, emperor snowball.<br/> We're gonna need to do another operation.<br/> Anything.<br/> Anything for my precious Morty.<br/> Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy.<br/> You could lose your kingdom.<br/> To hell with my kingdom, bean counter.<br/> I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.<br/> Do you think they would have done this for us? We are not them! We are not them.<br/> Assemble the troops.<br/> I've made a decision.<br/> Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty.<br/> Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory.<br/> I'm gonna miss you, snowball.<br/> You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.<br/> Jerry? I'm sorry.<br/> It's just like the end of ""Old Yeller.<br/>"" Oh, Jerry.<br/> You mean because it had dogs in it.<br/> Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs.<br/> I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.<br/> I think it will be great, Morty.<br/> You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages.<br/> I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop.<br/> You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.<br/> You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.<br/> What do you know, Morty? What do you know? Hi, guys.<br/> I'm your new teacher for scary class.<br/> My name is scary Mr.<br/> Johnson.<br/> Uh, actually, you know what? That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me scary Glenn, yeah? So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear.<br/> Which is what is that? You know? So, uh, here here's what I say you can't learn anything until you learn how to chill.<br/> Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.<br/> <br/>

 last king Christmas   last arrived   on the Christmas   Christmas  Mmm.<br/> Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham.<br/> Um, merry Christmas.<br/> Hello? My parents are coming over for the first time in years.<br/> Can we stow the gadgets and look alive? Alive? For your parents? - Mm, good one.<br/> - Hey, man! You ""hey, man!"" This holiday is about humanity.<br/> You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something.<br/> Whatever.<br/> All electronic items are going in the stocking now.<br/> Dad, I'm not giving you my phone.<br/> Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook.<br/> A-ho, ho, ho, everybody.<br/> More like ""whoa, whoa, whoa.<br/>"" What is this? My parents are coming! Calm down, Jerry.<br/> This is Reuben, an old friend.<br/> Pearl harbor.<br/> I check in on him once a year and give him a little medical evaluation.<br/> Aww! Dad, that is so sweet! Yeah, it is.<br/> I don't get it.<br/> Korea.<br/> Don't worry about your Christmas, Jerry.<br/> I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collins' proverbial paradise.<br/> Huh.<br/> You think you know a guy.<br/> Okay, there's my parents.<br/> Now, remember no TV, no phones, no laptops.<br/> We are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday.<br/> - Hey, hey! - Merry Christmas, son.<br/> Uh, hi.<br/> Can I help you? Jerry, this is Jacob.<br/> Didn't you get our text message? No! You must be Jerry.<br/> That's a fine-looking apron.<br/> - Williams-sonoma? - I wish! But thank you.<br/> So, you're a friend of the family? Uh, the way we see it, he's a part of the family.<br/> Wow.<br/> After your father's brush with cancer and losing your Uncle, we looked at life and wondered, how have we spent it, and how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die a list of fears and questions or a collection of real experiences? Holy crap.<br/> Joyce, that's amazing.<br/> Then Jacob came into our lives, and we're learning to live again.<br/> All three of us.<br/> Cool.<br/> - Eggnog? - Now we are talking! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh? Hi, Joyce.<br/> Leonard.<br/> - Hello, there.<br/> - Merry Christmas, man.<br/> Morty, a moment of your time? He's in bad shape, Morty.<br/> Aw, geez, Rick.<br/> What'd you do? Gee, thanks, Morty.<br/> What kind of monster do you think I am? I'm sitting here trying to save the guy's life.<br/> I need your help.<br/> I want you to find Dr.<br/> Xenon Bloom.<br/> He'll know what's going on.<br/> Uh, where where do I find Dr.<br/> Bloom? In Reuben.<br/> - Reuben, Minnesota? - Reuben on the table, Morty.<br/> Look, I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything.<br/> Just hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.<br/> What proc- - Hey, dad, where's Morty? - He's busy.<br/> Morty, can you hear me? Head north.<br/> Rick, where am I? Depending on my aim, you should be just South of the entrance.<br/> Entrance to what? Welcome, Morty.<br/> Welcome to anatomy park! It's a little business venture I've been cooking up on the side with Dr.<br/> Bloom an amusement park inside a human body.<br/> Science isn't cheap, Morty.<br/> This should really help put a dent in the overhead.<br/> Oh, my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder falls? Pirates of the pancreas? You got a problem with that last one, Morty? Huh? No, no.<br/> I'm just reading 'em out loud in the order that I'm seeing 'em.<br/> Okay.<br/> All right.<br/> If I sounded a little defensive, it's because pirates of the pancreas was my baby.<br/> You know, I got I got a lot of pushback when I pitched it, Morty.<br/> I guess I'm still a little defensive.<br/> Let's just find Dr.<br/> Bloom, all right? I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty.<br/> Proceed to the liver.<br/> Arriving at liver.<br/> Ow! Mind the gap.<br/> It's really scary in here, Rick.<br/> The liver's under maintenance.<br/> Reuben's seen some rough years, Morty.<br/> Don't judge.<br/> You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great.<br/> Rick! It's a monster! No, no, no.<br/> Morty.<br/> The only monster here is alco holism.<br/> That is an animatronic werewolf.<br/> Who are you?! Answer me! Where'd you come from? My my my grandpa Rick sent me! Poncho! That's quite enough.<br/> Morty, that's Poncho.<br/> This is Roger and Annie.<br/> And I am Dr.<br/> Xenon Bloom.<br/> Hey, Bloom, it's Rick.<br/> What the hell's going on here? I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down, and I'm afraid the exhibits are unlocked.<br/> Exhibits? Anatomy park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the Pirates of the pancreas.<br/> Watch it.<br/> It is, first and foremost, a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases.<br/> Diseases? Hey, doc.<br/> I got news for you.<br/> Your living museum is officially a wild safari! Hepatitis A! Run! Oh, the food goes in your mouth, girl.<br/> Oh, Jacob.<br/> I'm sorry, Jacob.<br/> I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents.<br/> Are you, like, uh are you, like, their caretaker? Is that what it is? - We can go into detail later, son.<br/> - Now, wait.<br/> Th-there's no point to secrecy.<br/> Let's all live and die honestly.<br/> Your mother and I have shared body, and soul, and when minds and souls are joined for eternity and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body and an opportunity to share and experiment.<br/> Dad, please.<br/> What are you saying? Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard, and we support you.<br/> Hey, speak for yourself, because it sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover.<br/> No, no, no, no, no, no.<br/> Jacob is your mother's lover.<br/> I watch them sometimes from a chair and sometimes from a closet, almost always dressed as superman.<br/> Oh.<br/> Jerry, this ham has got to be all you, right? It's incredible.<br/> Happy human holiday, dad.<br/> Aah! Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system.<br/> That's strange.<br/> Airflow is down 20%.<br/> So, the brain isn't getting enough oxygen.<br/> That's why security's offline.<br/> Well, I guess we better check it out.<br/> Hey! Wait for me! Put that back on! If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for a blockage.<br/> I'll go.<br/> - Don't be a hero, kid.<br/> - I'm not.<br/> I'm doing it because it's fun.<br/> We shouldn't be here.<br/> Whatever you do, do not fire that thing in here.<br/> We must save Reuben.<br/> This is my life's work.<br/> It's all right, my dear.<br/> Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of these bacteria, but the scar tissue keeps them Dormant.<br/> - Morty, get down! - Whoa-ho-ho! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, what are those things? Tuberculosis coming in fast! Not faster than a bullet! Aah! No! Do you know what you've done?! Whoa! Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing! Whoaaaa! Don't let me die! Just take a deep breath, Reuben.<br/> You're not gonna die! What's your name? My name is Alexand- Rick r-r-Reuben's got tuberculosis! Oh, great work, Morty.<br/> Okay, I'll just cure it and then- Okay.<br/> Well, I can't cure death.<br/> This is bad, Morty.<br/> You're trapped in a dead man.<br/> Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor and pop by pirates of the pancreas.<br/> Obviously I'm biased, but I think it's great, Morty.<br/> It's a bunch of Pirates running around a Pancreas.<br/> We don't whitewash it, either, Morty.<br/> I mean, the pirates are really rapey.<br/> The top priority is to get, you know, you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible, please, you gotta treat yourself.<br/> Oh, man.<br/> What is that horrible smell? You mean the panda express? Kidding.<br/> I-I'm kidding.<br/> The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas.<br/> We're inside a corpse, my boy.<br/> Anatomy park is doomed.<br/> Forget about the park, doctor! How do we get out? The digestive tract is the evacuation route.<br/> Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.<br/> Everybody, head for the colon! Now I'm taking orders from a Morty, the scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged.<br/> This disaster was an inside job.<br/> Keep your eye on Annie.<br/> She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.<br/> Intestines are ahead to the left, then to the right, then left, et cetera.<br/> Hey, just so you know, I'm actually 14.<br/> So, you know What? - Not 12.<br/> - Okay.<br/> You know, because he just said I was 12.<br/> Oh.<br/> Good for you.<br/> Oof.<br/> Ugh.<br/> Morty.<br/> Strike one.<br/>  It's a road of wonder   a trail of food   it's a pathway to break up   the bad and good   it's a tube that digests   and then sends out the rest   it's a small, small   intestine  It goes on like this for miles.<br/> Then we get to the large intestine! Shh! I hear something.<br/> Don't move.<br/> Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't move.<br/> Wait, I was wrong.<br/> I was thinking of a T.<br/> Rex.<br/> Move! We're sitting ducks! Doc, didn't you say that the body was filling with gas? - Yes.<br/> Why? - Kid, you're a genius.<br/> Are you mad?! Everybody, in here! Hey, gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation? Huh.<br/>  Drummer drum drum   drum drum drum   drum drum drum drum drum drum   Christmas drums  Oh, sing it, Summer.<br/>  Christmas drums   being played by a Bo-o-o-y  Oh, I love to hear you sing.<br/> Jerry, come on.<br/> This is what you wanted.<br/> I get it, Beth.<br/> Be careful what you wish for.<br/> I'm being punished for taking your iPad.<br/> What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier.<br/> Let's just be here.<br/> - Summer! - Ethan? What are you doing here? I've been texting you for hours! What the hell?! I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday! Well, did you even consider how that might make me feel?! How you feel?! Why is everything always happening to you?! Summer, do you have a boyfriend? Yeah, do you, Summer? I don't know, Ethan.<br/> Do I?! Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man.<br/> I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray online.<br/> If it works, we'll be regular-sized in a few minutes.<br/> I just hope Reuben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.<br/> - What the hell is that? - The sphincter dam.<br/> We built it when Reuben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse load.<br/> I've almost got it.<br/> Everybody, move inside the circle.<br/> Poncho? What is this in your backpack? That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho? Everybody, get back! Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me? That's right, baby.<br/> A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population.<br/> I'll take the highest bidder Al-qaeda, North Korea, Republicans, shriners, balding men that work out, people on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers.<br/> Anything is better than working for you, you pompous, negligent, iTunes-gift-card-as-a-holiday- bonus-giving mother- Come on! Aah! Get off! You guys! It's gonna burst! Go! Go, go, go! - My foot is stuck.<br/> - No! It's okay! It's okay.<br/> Just go.<br/> Tell my family I love them.<br/> They may be hard to find 'cause my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it, too, so, I-I don't know, you can- No! Let me ask you a question, Ethan.<br/> Where's the anger coming from, man? From Summer being a total bitch! Where's the anger coming from? My brother took me fishing once in the bushes I can't I can't He made me feel like a girl! He made me a girl! He didn't make you anything, man.<br/> You are who you are.<br/> She is who she is.<br/> Now, you go to her brand-new.<br/> Come here, right now.<br/> Oh, my God.<br/> I'm so sorry, Ethan! I love you! I love you so much.<br/> Um You did it again, cubbie.<br/> Come here.<br/> No! Stop! I hate this! Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son.<br/> Well, then I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame.<br/> My name's Reuben Ridley.<br/> You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey Whoopsie.<br/> I'll be inside all of you.<br/> My story begins during the dot-com crash in the early '90s.<br/> You can put your fingers wherever you want.<br/> Morty, you want to put it on mute or something? I'm I'm trying to concentrate.<br/> Uh Rick? Not now, Jerry.<br/> I've got much, much smaller fish to fry.<br/> I wanted to say I'm sorry I ever judged you.<br/> Right now, you're my sanest relative.<br/> Relative.<br/> Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite.<br/> Morty, can you get to the left nipple? Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of 'em, Rick.<br/> No, Morty, I'm talking about Reuben's left nipple.<br/> We need to get to the left nipple! The body is decaying.<br/> The arterial transit system is useless.<br/> We can try the service shuttle.<br/> It's connected to the skeletal system.<br/> That's why we call it the bone train.<br/> Would you like to ride the bone train, miss? If it'll get us out of here.<br/> How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the bone train? Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die! Let's go! Well I can see you're busy.<br/> Merry Christmas, Rick.<br/> There's no autopilot.<br/> One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.<br/> Uh, well No, you're you're right.<br/> It was a dick move for me to even pause like that.<br/> This is all my fault.<br/> You go on.<br/> What the hell is that? E.<br/> Coli outbreak.<br/> Hurry! - Wait, there is an autopilot.<br/> - Wait! It's okay! Never mind! I wanted to sacrifice myself anyway! They're they're chewing through the doors! We're in the areola, Rick, almost to the nipple, but we're also in a really bad situation! I'm almost there, Morty! Reports from all over the country have been coming in about what appears to be a giant, naked man over the continental United States.<br/> We now go to Tom Randolph in New York.<br/> Tom? Well, the eyes aren't twinkling and the dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a 70-mile cherry.<br/> Thank you, Tom.<br/> Let's go now to Eric McMahan in Los Angeles.<br/> We've got feet here on the west coast, Bill, giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size, and you know what they say about that.<br/> Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what's going down in the rocky mountains.<br/> Wha? Oh my God, the track! It's Hepatitis A! Aaaah! The nipple hole.<br/> It's beautiful.<br/> - Oh, no! - Holy crap! Whoa! It's Hepatitis C! Um wait did we have some sort of relationship with him? I think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys.<br/> Oh.<br/> Huh.<br/> Where's Dr.<br/> Bloom? I'm sorry, Rick, but he's dead.<br/> God damn it, Morty.<br/> I ask you to do one thing! Jerry doesn't know what he's missing.<br/> He'll come around, Beth.<br/> Christmas is a special time.<br/> It has funny ways of bringing families together.<br/> I don't know, Jacob.<br/> Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it.<br/> I don't know if our marriage will It's raining blood! Oh, shit.<br/> Find Jerry.<br/> Oh, God.<br/> - Jerry! - It's all right.<br/> The TV says there's nothing to worry about.<br/> The giant, naked sky Santa has exploded.<br/> Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country.<br/> Everything should be fine.<br/> Oh, yes.<br/> Dad, can I have my phone back? A sure, sweetie.<br/> Here.<br/> Everybody, take a device.<br/> It'll help you relax.<br/> - This is nice.<br/> - Yeah.<br/> Look, I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob.<br/> No, we didn't, dad.<br/> No, we didn't.<br/> Too bad about Dr.<br/> Bloom.<br/> He was a genius the only man capable of creating a new anatomy park.<br/> Actually, I studied Dr.<br/> Bloom's work.<br/> I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create an entirely new, much safer park.<br/> What about Pirates of the pancreas? I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.<br/> Boo-yah! Hold your breath.<br/> Hey, what the hell, Rick?! What the hell, man! I liked her! I really had something going there, Rick! Yeah, so I heard.<br/> You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me.<br/> - Puffy vagina.<br/> - What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me.<br/> I don't know.<br/> Come on, let's get some stuffing.<br/> I'm starving.<br/> Oh, unbelievable.<br/> We got we got a bunch of robot, computer people, sitting around with their faces stuffed into computer screens.<br/> Do you guys realize that Christ was born today? Jesus Christ, our savior, was born today.<br/> Are are are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this? Hey, Rick? Rick, can you hear me? Loud and clear, Annie.<br/> Great.<br/> We're also on with Alejandro, our chief imaginarian.<br/> Hey, Rick.<br/> Natalie Jacobs and Chris Deseter from microscopic marketing, Zack from organ concepts, and Jamie from new media.<br/> Hey, everybody.<br/> - Hi, how's it going? - Hi, Rick.<br/> So, pirates of the pancreas.<br/> Yeah.<br/> Talk to me.<br/> Hey, Rick.<br/> It's Alejandro speaking.<br/> Um, so, we asked ourselves, internally we asked ourselves over here, ""okay, what does a pancreas do?"" And the answer was, ""does it make pirates?"" No, it makes Insulin, you know? - So, we're starting with a new- - Those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park? Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Those people.<br/> This whole thing, Ethan.<br/> Cool.<br/> And who pays me?

This is just sloppy craftsmanship.<br/> Hey, Rick.<br/> Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh? Oh, yes, Morty.<br/> It's almost unbelievable, isn't it? Yeah, you know? There's something about the air and just the way the sunshine is.<br/> Uh, sure, buddy.<br/> Yeah.<br/> Sure.<br/> Brilliant.<br/> - Very convincing.<br/> - Convincing? Oh.<br/> Responsive, too.<br/> In real time.<br/> I love it.<br/> Uhh okay.<br/> I'm going to work.<br/> Morty, good morning.<br/> Dad, good morning.<br/> I am going to work.<br/> Goodbye.<br/> - What's with mom? - Oh, what's with mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How sophisticated.<br/> Careful, guys.<br/> You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one.<br/> Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too.<br/> Whatever, quote-unquote ""Morty.<br/>"" All right, well I'll see you after school.<br/> Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right.<br/> I'm okay.<br/> All right, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is? Morty? Uh, me? What is 5 x 9? Umm you know, it's uhh at least 40.<br/> Morty, that's exactly correct! Come up here.<br/> Whoo! Way to go, Morty! Everybody, this is the best student.<br/> I want you to be the teacher today.<br/> Teach us, Morty! Interesting.<br/> What do you want me to teach you? Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter? Oh, that's a good question.<br/> Concentrated huh? Concentrated dark matter the fuel for accelerated space travel.<br/> Now, do you know how to make it? Umm Come on, Morty.<br/> Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist? Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.<br/> I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot.<br/> You know, if you tell us, I'll be your girlfriend.<br/> Uh, y-you will? Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty.<br/> Morty, u-uh, come on.<br/> - There's a family emergency.<br/> - Stop right there! If he leaves, I'm giving him an ""F"".<br/> - He doesn't care.<br/> - Aw, man! Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! Ugh! Take a shower with me, Morty.<br/> - What?! - Listen to me, Morty.<br/> Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now.<br/> You got to trust me, Morty.<br/> Ugh! I'm gonna get an ""F"" in class, Rick.<br/> Morty, that's not class.<br/> That wasn't your teacher.<br/> This isn't your school.<br/> This entire world is not the world.<br/> We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.<br/> Wait a minute.<br/> W-what are you talking about? It's all fake, Morty all of it.<br/> Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of crazy fake nonsense, Morty.<br/> I couldn't say so until we got in the shower.<br/> They won't monitor us in here.<br/> Monitor us?! W-who?! Zigerion scammers, Morty.<br/> The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists.<br/> You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.<br/> Aw, come on, Rick.<br/> If everyone's just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.<br/> I can't let you do that, Morty.<br/> Give it to me! No! You give it to me! G-g-give it! No, Rick! Oh, God, sir! They're still naked! Ugh.<br/> Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not.<br/> I think we should make Kevin look, sir.<br/> What?! No! Why would you even say that? Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.<br/> If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to God, stu Something is drawing a lot of processing power.<br/> Oh, wait.<br/> No wonder.<br/> There's another real human in the simulator.<br/> Okay, Jerry big pitch meeting.<br/> Make-or-break time.<br/> You can do this.<br/> How did this happen?! Where's the abductions department? Hey, man, abductions just follows the acquisition order.<br/> Don't put this on acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated! Well, simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault.<br/> Oh, okay.<br/> I'm sorry.<br/> Well, then, problem solved.<br/> Oh, wait no.<br/> There's still another human in here! Who is he? Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith.<br/> So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.<br/> Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later.<br/> Rick Sanchez is the target.<br/> Got to relax.<br/> It's just a pitch.<br/> Got to relax.<br/> This is earth radio.<br/> And now, here's human music.<br/> Hmm.<br/> Human music.<br/> I like it.<br/> Rick! Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely.<br/> Look around you, Morty.<br/> Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details.<br/> Look that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.<br/> I don't know, Rick.<br/> I mean, I've seen people do that before.<br/> Well, look at that old lady.<br/> She's she's walking a cat on a leash.<br/> Uh, Mrs.<br/> Spencer does that all the time, Rick.<br/> Look, I-I-I don't want to hear about Mrs.<br/> Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! All right, all right, there.<br/> What about that, Morty? Okay, okay, you got me on that one.<br/> Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before? No, no.<br/> I haven't seen that.<br/> I mean, why would a pop tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live.<br/> You know what I mean? You're missing the point, Morty.<br/> Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.<br/> So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want? Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.<br/> We got the President of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die! Concentrated dark matter? They were asking about that in class.<br/> Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else.<br/> These zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty.<br/> They dragged you into this.<br/> - Now they're gonna pay! - What do you What are we gonna do? We'll scam the scammers, Morty.<br/> And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.<br/> National apple farmers of America, welcome to our ad agency.<br/> I'm Jerry Smith.<br/> All right.<br/> I'll just get to the pitch.<br/> Um, simple question, gentlemen, what are apples? Excuse me.<br/> What are apples? Apples are food.<br/> And when do we need food? When we're hungry.<br/> With that, I give you your new slogan! Well, say something! - Do you like it? - Yes.<br/> - You do? - Yes.<br/> So I sold it? I sold the idea? - Yes.<br/> - Oh, my God! Thank you! - Thank you.<br/> - You're welcome.<br/> Hey! I just sold my first pitch! Slow down! Lookin' good.<br/> My man! Hello.<br/> Guess who just sold the apples campaign.<br/> Who just sold the apples campaign? Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of ""got milk?"" after all.<br/> - Guess someone was wrong.<br/> - Yes.<br/> Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I've got an erection the size of an east coast lighthouse, and I'm coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.<br/> - Okay.<br/> - Wait really? - Yes.<br/> - Yes! See you in 10 minutes! Hey! I'm going to make love to my wife! Lookin' good.<br/> - Slow down! - My man! Aw, geez, Rick.<br/> I don't know if I like this plan, you know? I mean, crowds, they have a tendency to make me really nervous.<br/> Morty, relax.<br/> It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there.<br/> You're gonna be fine.<br/> Just follow my lead.<br/> Yo, deejay, drop that beat.<br/> Uh-oh, Morty.<br/> This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts.<br/> I don't think we can perform our new song, ""the recipe for concentrated dark matter"", for a crowd this tiny.<br/> You got that right, Rick.<br/> Now that's more like it! Morty, here we go.<br/> Let me hear everybody say ""hey-oh!"" Yeah! All the ladies say, ""yeah!"" Everybody over 30, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! Yeah, don't move.<br/> Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an ""L"" who isn't hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times 10! Run, Morty! Before the system reboots! Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?! Oh, my God.<br/> That's the best sex I've ever had in my life.<br/> It's it's too good.<br/> I don't deserve this, Beth.<br/> I'm a fraud.<br/> Oh, man, Rick! Where we running to? Out of the simulation, Morty.<br/> Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to The edge.<br/> Here we go.<br/> Holy crap! Come on, Morty.<br/> Sir, they're over the edge.<br/> Yes, they are.<br/> Just as planned.<br/> Oh, this is going to be such a mind- Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty.<br/> That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.<br/> So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them? It's an obsession for them at this point.<br/> The zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty.<br/> Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them.<br/> Aha! Here we go.<br/> Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty.<br/> These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips.<br/> I've got so many, I can barely hold them all.<br/> Look at look at this.<br/> Oops.<br/> I dropped one.<br/> Don't worry about it, Morty.<br/> There's plenty of them, you little goofball.<br/> Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha! Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it! Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.<br/> Wow.<br/> What do you know? Huh.<br/> That was easy.<br/> Totes malotes, dawg.<br/> Just kind of hard to believe, you know? Believe it, Morty.<br/> And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the zigerions got nothing of mine.<br/> Mr.<br/> Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk? Yes.<br/> Look, I'm a fraud.<br/> I mean, let's face it, ""hungry for apples"" is just a rip-off of ""got milk?"" It's almost identical.<br/> - Yes.<br/> - Okay.<br/> I deserve that.<br/> Umm I guess I'll just pack up my desk.<br/> Yes.<br/> Oh, my God.<br/> Wait.<br/> You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! There's not even a single word in ""hungry for apples"" that's shared by ""got milk?"".<br/> It's a completely different slogan.<br/> It's different! And I shouldn't be fired.<br/> - I should be promoted! - Yes.<br/> Yeah! Wait.<br/> Really? - Yes.<br/> - Yes! I mean, I'm it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out - of this agency in a long time.<br/> - Yes.<br/> I'm not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an appley or something.<br/> Yes.<br/> Is there really an award called the appley for apple-related ad campaigns? Yes.<br/> - Could we nominate me? - Yes.<br/> Holy crap! Get in, Morty.<br/> I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff.<br/> Huh.<br/> I thought I entered the code right.<br/> Wha well, what's this? What could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're inside a simulation Inside a simulation.<br/> You're still on the ship.<br/> Game-day bucket go boom.<br/> Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was- Too loud, Cynthia.<br/> Too loud and too specific.<br/> We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time.<br/> But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours! Uh, yeah, until I get home before you, and change the combination, you bunch of idiots! That is why you're never getting home.<br/> Get them! Run, Morty! Oh, my God! Ow! I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed.<br/> Now I'm holding one.<br/> And um Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's more meaningful than that.<br/> My man! Yes.<br/> Thank you, sir.<br/> I am finally complete! My my my my man! What the hell?! No.<br/> - Jerry?! - Dad! What are you doing here? Why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it.<br/> We don't have time.<br/> - Come on.<br/> - No! Ohhhhh! Aah! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oof! Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers.<br/> Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick! I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.<br/> Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick? Yeah.<br/> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br/> Uh, check the engine room.<br/> We just need cesium, plutonic quarks, and bottled water.<br/> It's all here, Rick! Wow, Morty.<br/> Lucky break.<br/> Grab that bucket.<br/> Okay, two parts plutonic quarks, one part cesium.<br/> Okay.<br/> Uh-huh.<br/> All right.<br/> Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time! Oh, no.<br/> What the- No! Oh, my God, Rick.<br/> How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation Of a simulation Inside another giant simulation! We never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter.<br/> But we do now! We do now, sucka! You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! You bunch of diabolical sons of bitches! Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.<br/> You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, am I? All right.<br/> Okay.<br/> All right, great.<br/> Wonderful.<br/> You win.<br/> Can we go home now? I don't know.<br/> Can you? Ha! Nice.<br/> Okay, okay.<br/> Show this gullible turd to his shuttle.<br/> I'm done with him.<br/> Oh, wait.<br/> Let me get a picture.<br/> Aww.<br/> Look at his face.<br/> He's trying to figure out if he's in a simulation still.<br/> Are you, Rick? Are you? You're not.<br/> Or are you? Oh, and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps.<br/> That was part of the simulation.<br/> Oh.<br/> Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then? Yeah! Of course you should! No, keep it.<br/> Move it up, actually, if you can.<br/> Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it.<br/> So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity? You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too.<br/> You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us.<br/> Maybe you're right, Jerry.<br/> Maybe you're right.<br/> All right, everybody.<br/> Two parts plutonic quarks One part cesium And listen, I'm sorry for yelling earlier.<br/> I couldn't ask for a better staff.<br/> I love you guys, and I love all your families.<br/> And the final ingredient Whoa! What the hell?! What happened back there? Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah.<br/> You can't.<br/> They blew up.<br/> So What do you think? You're fired.<br/> Wha- But this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.<br/> Well, then, it was a terrible simulation.<br/> Get out.<br/> Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife? Hey, Morty.<br/> What? Hey, little buddy.<br/> How you doing in here right now? Aw, geez, Rick.<br/> What are you doing, man? You're a good kid, Morty.<br/> You're a real little character, Morty.<br/> Oh, boy.<br/> You know, I had a really rocky road today, Morty.<br/> You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, Morty? You're a real true hero out in the field.<br/> You're a real trouper, huh, Morty? Have you been drinking, Rick? I really appreciate you, Morty.<br/> Okay, cool.<br/> All right, Rick you little son of a bitch! Are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?! No! No! No! You little son of a bitch! I'm sorry, Morty.<br/> You're a good you're a good kid, Morty.<br/> Geez! You're a good you're a good kid.<br/> Oh, my God! What the hell? What a life.<br/> Corrections by XhmikosR   <br/>

Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man.<br/> Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying! Hey, look, we get it.<br/> You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, ""hey, he's a giant.<br/> Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"" Th-th but that's not how it went down! Oh, well, it's going down like that.<br/> You're both going down like that.<br/> Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done.<br/> Real straightforward and fun.<br/> Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you.<br/> The most important love you can receive is from yourself.<br/> Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club! Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?! Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this.<br/> You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you.<br/> Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me! - Just try to relax.<br/> - You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox! Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful.<br/> I can't imagine what you two must be going through.<br/> Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry.<br/> You're kidding me.<br/> Notice anything different? I'm sorry.<br/> Hours? Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her! Uhh Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long.<br/> It's getting weird.<br/> Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.<br/> Oh, great adventure, buddy.<br/> Rick and Morty go to giant prison.<br/> You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty.<br/> You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that.<br/> - We're gonna be okay, Rick.<br/> - How? They took my portal gun.<br/> This is an open-and-shut case, Morty.<br/> You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then- Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss.<br/> These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.<br/> W-what the hell is he talking about? They're free to go, is what I meant.<br/> I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say.<br/> We're giants.<br/> Nobody got that? Whatever.<br/> Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it! All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working.<br/> You ready to head home? Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet.<br/> You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.<br/> Morty, cut your losses.<br/> This is obviously a wash.<br/> Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps.<br/> Oh, boy, Morty.<br/> Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.<br/> What do you say, Morty? I say give me a hand, sidekick.<br/> Everybody shut up! Let me try! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I'm going out.<br/> Wait.<br/> What? Well, you're busy.<br/> I'm hungry.<br/> I thought I'd go out.<br/> Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison? Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is I'll take you to dinner.<br/> Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too.<br/> I'll be right there.<br/> Look, I've got a marriage to keep together.<br/> At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.<br/> I can't take it anymore.<br/> I just want to die! We all want to die! We're Meeseeks! Why did you even rope me into this? 'Cause he roped me into this! Well, him over there, he roped me into this! Well, he roped me into this! Well, what about me? He roped me into this.<br/> Well, that one over there roped me into this.<br/> Well, he roped me into this.<br/> Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.<br/> All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid.<br/> Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there.<br/> Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step.<br/> Oh, wow, Rick.<br/> Now, this is more like it.<br/> Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here.<br/> All kinds of crazy characters.<br/> This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun.<br/> What are you looking at, mother- Easy, Rick.<br/> Pay them no mind.<br/> Those stair goblins can be moody.<br/> Now, what can I getcha? We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies.<br/> Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words? Rick We'll have two bloogies, please.<br/> And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs? Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippely-slippery stair.<br/> I'll take you down there for I don't know how much I don't know what that is.<br/> Is that a lot? Is it a little? That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.<br/> Hi, I'm Mr.<br/> booby buyer.<br/> I'll buy those boobies for It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline.<br/> Rats! What a shame.<br/> Morty, your adventure's in a spiral.<br/> For real, man, time to pull out.<br/> You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! - You know why? - Uh, because it's lame? It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick.<br/> Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here! Whatever.<br/> It's become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem.<br/> - I'm Mr.<br/> Meeseeks.<br/> - I'm Mr.<br/> Meeseeks.<br/> Look at me.<br/> The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution.<br/> Look at me.<br/> I'm Mr.<br/> Meeseeks.<br/> I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked.<br/> I fear the worst.<br/> Your failures are your own, old man.<br/> I'm Mr.<br/> Meeseeks! Look at me.<br/> I say follow-through! Who's with me?! Follow-through! I'm Mr.<br/> Meeseeks! Look at me! Kill him! How are you today? - I'm Mr.<br/> jelly bean.<br/> - Hi, Mr.<br/> jelly bean.<br/> I'm Morty.<br/> My grandpa and I are on an adventure.<br/> - Nice.<br/> Is it a fun adventure? - I hope so.<br/> But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.<br/> Isn't that what adventures do? Hey, you know what? You're right.<br/> Everything's going fine.<br/> I just got to relax and go with the flow.<br/> Yeah.<br/> Okay.<br/> Uh.<br/> B-bye.<br/> Uhh, no, stay.<br/> Go with the flow.<br/> Stop.<br/> You're making me really uncomfortable.<br/> Stop fighting me.<br/> Just let this happen.<br/> Get off of me!  Sweet home Alabama  Whoo! No! Stop! Please! Stop being such a tease, you sweet little- No! No! Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood.<br/> None of us can die until our job is done.<br/> The job can't be done! We'll never get two strokes off his game! No, we won't.<br/> But we will get all strokes off his game.<br/> Where's he going with this? What's he mean? When we kill him.<br/> Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about.<br/> Where would you go? I don't know, man.<br/> Italy.<br/> Greece.<br/> Argentina.<br/> Countries known for their sexually aggressive men.<br/> Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut? What the heck? There he is! Run, Jerry! Come on out, Jerry! Guys, I'll choke up.<br/> I'll follow through.<br/> I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay? Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.<br/> Come on, Rick, quit stalling.<br/> What do ya got? Read 'em and weep, fellas! Oh, hey, Morty.<br/> Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure.<br/> I'm havin' a good time, Morty.<br/> - It's not so bad.<br/> - Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it.<br/> The adventure's over.<br/> We can't leave now, Morty.<br/> - I'm on fire! - Look, I want to leave now.<br/> You win the bet, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please.<br/> Please, I just want to go home.<br/> Okay.<br/> Listen, Morty.<br/> I just won a bunch of shmeckels.<br/> Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh? - Really? - Sure, Morty.<br/> Yeah.<br/> You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.<br/> Buckle up! Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry.<br/> And we will do anything to alleviate that pain.<br/> Just ask Aah! what's your name, ma'am? Samantha.<br/> Please, mister! Give him what he wants! Innocent people are going to die because of me.<br/> Why am I so mediocre? Jerry, turn around.<br/> Straighten your back.<br/> Bend your knees.<br/> Bend them.<br/> Square your shoulders.<br/> Take a deep breath.<br/> I love you.<br/> I'm counting to three, Jerry.<br/> What the is going on? He's got it! That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke! Excuse me.<br/> I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks.<br/> What about your short game? Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?! Ooh, nice! I think we'll take our food to go.<br/> No, you won't.<br/> The police are coming.<br/> You have so many questions to answer.<br/> Fair enough.<br/> Thank you, kind sir.<br/> Our village is saved! You are both true heroes! Good job, Morty.<br/> Looks like you won the bet.<br/> Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should.<br/> You know, you were right about the universe.<br/> It's a crazy and chaotic place.<br/> Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know.<br/> This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.<br/> Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally.<br/> Uh, no, I-it's cool.<br/> Rick.<br/> Portal.<br/> Hurry.<br/> So You still thinking about taking that trip? Jerry, look.<br/> We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere.<br/> When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to ""complete their task.<br/>"" Was I one of those guys? The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.<br/> Well I got you pregnant.<br/> Yeah What the hell happened to this place? Uh, your Meeseeks box happened.<br/> They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game.<br/> He felt terrible.<br/> Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.<br/> Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up? Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.<br/> No.<br/> No more boxes.<br/> What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it.<br/> Wubba lubba dub dubs! Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio.<br/> Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show.<br/> Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody.<br/> I don't get it.<br/> Sir, I think you're going to want to see this.<br/> We found it inside a lockbox inside king jelly bean's closet.<br/> We have to tell the people.<br/> Wait.<br/> Destroy it.<br/> Our people will get more from the idea he represented than from the jelly bean he actually was.<br/> <br/>

Principal vagina here.<br/> Don't let the name fool you.<br/> I'm very much in charge reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance.<br/> I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home.<br/> Hey.<br/> The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration.<br/> You don't bring dead babies to passover.<br/> Okay.<br/> Here we go.<br/> Hey, Jessica.<br/> Uh What's up, Morty? What are you doing? Um Wait, wait.<br/> Were you about to talk to her? Well I mean, I was thinking about it.<br/> Dude, stay in your league.<br/> Look at how hot she is.<br/> You don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hitting on their prettiest girl.<br/> Gee, thanks, Brad.<br/> I throw balls far.<br/> You want good words? Date a languager.<br/> Try not to worry about it, Morty.<br/> You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.<br/> You're missing the point, dad.<br/> I don't want girls.<br/> I want Jessica.<br/> Ah, well, I remember feeling that way about a young lady named ""your mom,"" and that's not an urban diss.<br/> Your mom was my Jessica.<br/> I remember the first time I saw her.<br/> I thought, ""I should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me.<br/>"" I beg your pardon, Rick.<br/> Inappropriate.<br/> Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.<br/> I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty.<br/> His marriage is hanging from a thread.<br/> My marriage is fine, thank you.<br/> Jerry, it's your house whatever you say it is is how it is but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door.<br/> I barely have a reason to care, and even inoticed.<br/> Come on, Rick! Don't talk about my parents like that.<br/> Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.<br/> It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage.<br/> I did it.<br/> Your parents are gonna do it.<br/> Break the cycle, Morty.<br/> Rise above.<br/> Focus on science.<br/> All right, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.<br/> Yeah, I'm just going to check on your mom.<br/> Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty.<br/> It's gonna be great.<br/> Hey, listen, Rick.<br/> You know how you said that, you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? Well, I was thinking, you know, could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing? You know, like, maybe make some sort of love potion or something? Morty, that's such a poor use of my time.<br/> It's beneath me.<br/> Hand me the screwdriver.<br/> You know what? No, Rick! I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver.<br/> I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick! I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing.<br/> What about me, Rick? Why can't you just help me out once once for once? You're growing up fast, Morty.<br/> You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass.<br/> Listen, this is called oxytocin.<br/> I extracted it from a vole.<br/> Do you know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? It's a it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty.<br/> This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know, that makes it fall in love.<br/> All right, Morty, I just got to combine it with some of your DNA.<br/> Oh, well, okay.<br/> A hair, Morty.<br/> I need one of your hairs.<br/> - This isn't ""game of thrones.<br/>"" - Ow! All right, Morty.<br/> Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever.<br/> - Are you happy now, Morty? - Heck, yeah! Thank you, grandpa Rick.<br/> Hey, there's no dangers or anything, or side effects, right? What am I, a hack? Go nuts, Morty.<br/> It's foolproof.<br/> Eh, unless she has the flu.<br/> - Beth, do you still love me? - Ugh, what kind of question is that? The ""yes or no"" kind? Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes? - Yes.<br/> - Are you gonna build them? - No.<br/> - Then what good was the ""yes""? Wait, is loving me the house or the homeless people? Loving you is work, Jerry hard work, like building a homeless shelter nobody wants to say no to doing it, but some people put the work in.<br/> So, what do you say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me? Sort of.<br/> Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I? So stop asking, and maybe I'll love you more.<br/> Crap, they need me at the horse hospital.<br/> This late? The racetrack had a starlight derby.<br/> There was a seven-horse collision, and Davin's there alone.<br/> Davin.<br/> Davin! Davin.<br/> Davin! Davin! Davin! Davin!  Flu, yo   you got to be aware   aware of all the flu   up in the air   I'm-a get me a shot   and make the flu go away   flu-hating rapper   just rapping away   yo, yo, flu-hating rapper   it's a flu-hating rapper  Hey, there, Jessica.<br/> Whoa! Oh, whoopsie! Oh, my God.<br/> Morty.<br/> You look really nice tonight.<br/> Wow, thanks.<br/> I love you, Morty! I love you so much it burns! Oh, man! I love you too, Jessica! Is this punk bothering you, Jessica? Leave him alone, jerk! I'm in love with him! He is more man than you will ever be!  This is about   flu awareness   got to be aware of the flu in   the air-ness   yo, I'm a flu-hating rapper  Oh, man, Morty.<br/> I'm really sorry.<br/> Oh, well, no problem, Brad.<br/> There's something special about you, Morty so special.<br/> - Mmm, yeah.<br/> - Whoa, take it easy! Get your hands off of him! - Back off! - I'm trying to be with my man! That's enough, Bradley! We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.<br/> Oh, come on, principal Vagina.<br/> Never leave me, Morty.<br/> Never! Uh, sure.<br/> I mean, of course not.<br/> What do you think that was all about? Who cares? Just hold me.<br/> Let me go! I love you, Morty! Let go of me! Morty! She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.<br/> Yeah, dad, digging around the insides of horses.<br/> It's not a very romantic setting.<br/> Well, Summer, there's always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up.<br/> Maybe Davin's digging around in her insides.<br/> Grandpa, so gross! You're talking about my mom.<br/> Well, she's my daughter, Summer.<br/> I outrank you.<br/> Or family means nothing, in which case don't play that card.<br/> She's not responding to my texts! Careful, dad.<br/> Jealousy turns women off.<br/> Well, isn't that convenient? Not for the men they cheat on, no.<br/> Okay, I'm going to go out for some ice cream.<br/> And maybe stop by the hospital to support my wife with my confidence.<br/> - God, grandpa, you're such a dick.<br/> - I'm sorry, Summer.<br/> Your opinion means very little to me.<br/> How come you're not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much? Screw that.<br/> I don't want to get sick.<br/> - It's flu season.<br/> - It is? - Yeah.<br/> - Uh-oh.<br/> Please just let this work out.<br/> Do it, Morty.<br/> Do it.<br/> Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life! Um Can we maybe go somewhere more private? Jessica, get a hold of yourself! You don't deserve to carry Morty's genes.<br/>  I love Morty   and I hope Morty loves me   I'd like to wrap my arms   around him   and feel him inside me  Oh, crap.<br/> Morty! Morty, come on! We got to get you out of here.<br/> You're not gonna believe this, because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake.<br/> Come on, Morty.<br/> We got to get out of here.<br/> Morty! - Are you okay? - I'm fine! Oh, good.<br/> If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself.<br/> I love you bad, mo-mo! Morty, the principal and I have discussed it, and we're both insecure enough to agree to a three-way! I didn't realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu, you know, that might have been valuable information for me, Morty.<br/> What the hell is going on, Rick? What does it look like? The serum is piggybacking on the virus.<br/> It's gone airborne, Morty.<br/> Oh, crap.<br/> What are we gonna do, Rick? It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax.<br/> I whipped up and antidote.<br/> It's based on praying-mantis You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty.<br/> I mean, they they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner.<br/> I mean, it's a whole ritual.<br/> It's really gruesome and totally opposite.<br/> There's no love at all.<br/> I basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus.<br/> It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty.<br/> It'll all be over very shortly.<br/> Morty! Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn't ask or anything, but I'm not interested in having sex with you.<br/> These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically.<br/> Morty! Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty.<br/> A lot of people don't get that.<br/> Come on.<br/> Are you kidding me? Hello! Morty! You're not Morty! Bring us Morty! Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.<br/> I had sex with Billy.<br/> But you were already pregnant! Yeah, so what's the worst that could happen? We interrupt ""pregnant baby"" with breaking news.<br/> Come on.<br/> This just in; Morty Smith's whereabouts are still unknown.<br/> What the hell? The only thing that is known is how cute he is.<br/> I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head.<br/> I love him more than you do, Harold! You wish, you stupid bitch! Morty's mine! Morty's mine! Meant to be together! Morty! Where is Morty? Oh, my God, Rick.<br/> The whole world is infected! Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread.<br/> I've really outdone myself.<br/> Outdone yourself?! Are you kidding me, Rick? This is not okay! Not only do they all want to have sex with me, but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards! Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.<br/> Mantises are they opposite of voles? I mean, obviously, DNA's a little more complicated than that.<br/> You know what, though, Morty? This right here's gonna do the trick, baby.<br/> It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur.<br/> Should add up to normal humanity.<br/> That doesn't make any sense, Rick.<br/> How does that add up to normal humanity? What, Morty, you want me to show you my math? I'm sorry are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid? Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses, but I'm almost sorry we're finished.<br/> Yes, it's satisfying work.<br/> Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh it's more than the work.<br/> I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world.<br/> It's the only time I can really think and feel.<br/> Hmm, uh, what are you doing? I'm playing African dream pop.<br/> What do you do after a long night? Oh, ha, um, hey, I'd better get going.<br/> Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff.<br/> Beth What is it, Davin? Just once, I'd like to know what it was like to give your son a bath.<br/> What?! What does Morty's skin smell like? How soft How soft are his privates? Let go of me, Davin! Take me to Morty.<br/> You're not Morty.<br/> No.<br/> I'm Mr.<br/> Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar.<br/> That's stupid.<br/> Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you.<br/> Jerry! Thank God! God? God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth.<br/> I'm the one beating them to death.<br/> Thank me.<br/> Thank you, Jerry.<br/> Thank you.<br/> Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal.<br/> Just do it already.<br/> Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush.<br/> I mean, you know, once it's fixed, it's done.<br/> It's fixed.<br/> You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit.<br/> I mean, look at how crazy it is.<br/> I mean, Morty, when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? I mean, soak it in, you know? It's it's pretty neat.<br/> - It's pretty interesting.<br/> - That's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever.<br/> What do we have here, Morty? Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh? I bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh? I bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty.<br/> Oh, Rick, something's not right.<br/> Yeah, you.<br/> - You're not right ever.<br/> - No, no! Look, you idiot! Bet you're loving this, Morty.<br/> This must be the best day of your life.<br/> You get to be the mayor of ""I told you"" town.<br/> You're welcome.<br/> Hold on.<br/> I wish that shotgun was my penis.<br/> If it were, you could call me Ernest Hemingway.<br/> I don't get it, and I don't need to.<br/> Mom! Dad! - Summer! - Summer! - Where's Morty? - I don't know.<br/> Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this? It's not fair to assume that, Summer.<br/> Oh, not fair? Give me a break.<br/> He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother.<br/> A real man stands by his woman.<br/> Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo.<br/> Tchoo-tchoo.<br/> Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't I? We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty.<br/> At least they're not in love with you anymore, though.<br/> That's a huge step in the right direction.<br/> Oh, my God! It's a living nightmare! How could you be so irresponsible, Rick? Me irresponsible?! All I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty! You're the one who wanted me to buckle down and make you up a roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school.<br/> I mean, are you kidding me, Morty? You're gonna try to take the high road on this one? You're a little creep, Morty.<br/> You're you're just a little creepy creep person.<br/> All right, fine.<br/> I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum.<br/> I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick.<br/> But I'll tell you something you know what? You got to accept your part of the blame! I'm not the one who fouled up the serum! I'm not the one who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs! You got to fix this, Rick! All right, all right, Morty.<br/> You know, we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking.<br/> Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting.<br/> Wow, Rick, I got to say, you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time.<br/> I mean, I really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do.<br/> Whoo! That's some great luck.<br/> Come on, Morty.<br/> Luck had nothing to do with it.<br/> I'm great.<br/> That's the real reason.<br/> Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy? Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis defibulizer? Sure thing, Rick.<br/> Here's a screwdriver.<br/> All right, Morty.<br/> Thank you very much.<br/> We got one screw turn and two screw turns and All right, Morty, here we are.<br/> Oh, my God, Rick! Is that us?! We're dead! What is going on, Rick? I'm freaking out! Calm down, Morty! Look at me! Calm down, Morty! No, I can't deal with this! - Calm yourself, Morty.<br/> - I can't deal with this, Rick! - Calm down, Morty.<br/> - This can't be real! You got to calm down, Morty.<br/> We're ripped apart! Shut up and listen to me! It's fine.<br/> Everything is fine.<br/> There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal.<br/> I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time.<br/> Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine.<br/> We're not skipping a beat, Morty.<br/> - Now, help me with these bodies.<br/> - This is insane.<br/> Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay? I mean, that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.<br/> Rick, what about the reality we left behind? What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is don't think about it.<br/> It's not like we can do this every week, anyways.<br/> We get three or four more of these, tops.<br/> Now, pick up your dead self and come on.<br/> Haste makes waste.<br/> I don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome.<br/>  Look on down from the bridge   there's still fountains down there   look on down from the bridge   it's still raining up here   everybody seems so   far away from me   everybody just   wants to be free   look away from the sky   it's no different when you're   leaving home   I can't be the same   thing to you now   I'm just gone   just gone   how could I say goodbye?   How could I say goodbye?  You know, the thing about a shark He's got lifeless eyes black eyes, like a doll's eyes.<br/> When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya, and then the the blood, and the red, and the water You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty? Sometimes.<br/> But, I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone, I'm finally happy.<br/> Here we are, cronenberg Morty, a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged.<br/> We'll fit right in, cronenberg Morty.<br/> It'll be like we never even left cronenberg world.<br/> Yeah, cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know? I mean, I wish we hadn't genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around.<br/> Don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg Morty.<br/> Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?   <br/>

Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator.<br/> That is multiphase quantum resonator.<br/> - Well, does it defraculate? - No.<br/> Then it's a broken defraculator.<br/> Like you would even know dick about fraculation.<br/> Your planet just got cellphones and the coverage still sucks! Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur.<br/> So lets say 60 smidgens.<br/> I tell you what I'll do you a favor.<br/> I throw in a fart.<br/> Hey, Rick You think maybe I could get something from this place? Like a souvenir? Like just to have, like something cool, you know? Not here Morty.<br/> We'll stop somewhere else, because you know, there is always another pawn shop.<br/> OK, I just You know, I thought that robot over there, looked pretty cool, you know? Oh, it looks cool, huh? - That's why you want it? - Yeah, you know? I mean it's different from the stuff on earth.<br/> And you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy and you know, I don't really have anything to to remember all those trips by.<br/> It'd be kind of cool like a souvenir, you know? Like what if you passed away or died or something? I wouldn't even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did, you know.<br/> Okay, 60 for the resonator and my grandson wants the sex robot.<br/> Corrections by XhmikosR So we're just going to pretend this isn't happening? I'm not saying that's a bad idea.<br/> Just asking.<br/> Rick, why did you let Morty bring that thing into our house? What do you want from me? He thought it looked cool, you know what I mean? Alright, back to back to back upstairs.<br/> Well, I'm intervening.<br/> Intervening with puberty? You'll turn him into Ralph Finnes in Red Dragon.<br/> He is at that age, let's just be proud of him.<br/> Jesus, did I really set the bar that low? Rick, could you come with me please? Quickly! OK, now if we here squeaking we intervene.<br/> Where is the sex robot Morty? That is Gwendoline.<br/> I mean the robot.<br/> She started beeping, and then transformed and tried to fly away.<br/> Strange.<br/> That's usually the man's job.<br/> You know what I'm talking about, Morty? Morty.<br/> That's my catchphrase, remember? Remember how I cemented that catchphrase? Alright, alright seriously though.<br/> Let me grab this thing.<br/> Come on.<br/> - Rascal.<br/> - Okay unacceptable What is going on? Alright What is that? I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends.<br/> Genetic compiler, incubation chamber.<br/> Yeah, this here is some kind of baby maker.<br/> And that there is half Morty and half who knows what.<br/> It's my bad guys I'll take care of it.<br/> Hey listen, you guys quarantine the house when Summer brought olives from Mexico.<br/> This thing could grow to the size of Delaware.<br/> It might eat brains and exhale space AIDS.<br/> We gotta be careful.<br/> I lost the chance to be careful, Rick.<br/> I'm a father now, you know? It's time for me to be responsible.<br/> Isn't that right - Don't name it! - Morty Jr.<br/>? Oh crap, he named it.<br/> Well Dad, it's a living thing.<br/> And it's half human.<br/> And it was born on America's soil which entitles it Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake.<br/> Don't punish us for it.<br/> Fine.<br/> I'm gonna take this thing into my workshop, and do a little bit of investigating.<br/> Do not let that thing out of your sight.<br/> It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous.<br/> - Like the Insane Clown Posse.<br/> - Yeah, good one, Jerry.<br/> wants its easy target back.<br/> He is a like little me.<br/> You don't think he'll turn into a monster, do you? They always do.<br/> their ""certain year called wanting its blank back"" formula back.<br/> Why, Jerry? Why expend the effort? Life is effort, and I'll stop when I die.<br/> Out.<br/> - What you doing? - Well, I can't solve the problem my way thanks to your family's primitive biological hang ups.<br/> Gross.<br/> I might have just touched one of Morty's loads.<br/> But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr.<br/> on this robot homeworld, which is Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system.<br/> - Scoot Summer.<br/> - Don't you need a new companion now that Morty is in the family way? I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer.<br/> Oh right, because there is something about having a wiener that would make me better walking through a hole? Oh crap.<br/> Grandpa Rick! Help! Help! Grandpa Rick! Still think it's a good idea to go through a hole without a wiener? - I wanna go home! - Yeah, no duh.<br/> Great, now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs.<br/> You're doing great, Morty.<br/> Really you think? I mean I'm not doing much of anything.<br/> What do I do if it cries? Then you put it down and let it cry itself out.<br/> Yeah, right.<br/> We tried that technique on Summer and she is gonna end up stripping.<br/> Isn't she? Yes she is.<br/> She is gonna strip her attention because she was denied it.<br/> Stop filling it with your own insecurity.<br/> You're gonna turn it into Mort more more more of you.<br/> Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally-ill scientist.<br/> What the Listen to me.<br/> I am not rewarding this behavior.<br/> Knock it off both of you! Give me him! Give me my baby! You're both nuts.<br/> I'm gonna raise Morty Jr.<br/> myself.<br/> Where is your hands? There's your hands.<br/> And that's how we play happy hands.<br/> Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty.<br/> At least we can agree on that.<br/> Thanks, dumb dumb.<br/> I said ""thanks, dumb dumb"".<br/> Go get more.<br/> Summer, put your burqa on! That burqa is a human rights violation, and I spent a lot on this top.<br/> Look, I'm trying to repair portal gun with with bunch of sex doll parts and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from cutting you off.<br/> The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender.<br/> What's the deal with this place? Why is it such a sausage planet and how did such backwards idiots invent robots? Obviously at some point the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines.<br/> The resultant lack of distraction and handpecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bombed themselves back to the stone age and now they just fight with each other over fake pussy with sticks and rocks all day long.<br/> You think it's efficient to get rid of women? You ever see a line for the men's room? Are you hea Do you lis You hear me, summer? The plot thickens.<br/> You might wanna cover your eyes, Summer.<br/> Yeah, like it was my dream to watch.<br/> Summer, grab hold.<br/> Grandpa Rick, where are we going? Well obviously Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class.<br/> Sound familiar? Ticketmaster.<br/> There we go, Summer.<br/> Hey brother.<br/> Hey bro.<br/> Nice racket you got going on here.<br/> Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from earth dimension C-137.<br/> Don't mean any harm.<br/> Coming in peace.<br/> It's all cool in the good in the neighborhood.<br/> That was what I was trying That's what I meant.<br/> Oh, I get it.<br/> The old ""behind every great man amazon"" twist.<br/> Silence! Your slave is ill-mannered.<br/> - My slave? - We assume you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants.<br/> If he is a rogue male, tell us now, and we will kill him.<br/> He's my slave.<br/> He's my slave.<br/> He is definitely my slave.<br/> Oh boy, what's the opposite of Am I right ladies and gentlemen? You guys kidding me.<br/> Morty Jr.<br/>, you're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you? You're my special little guy.<br/> DA What was that, Morty Jr.<br/>? Were you gonna say Dada? Say Dada.<br/> Death! Dada.<br/> Domination! Dada? Destruction, domination.<br/> Nice.<br/> The spider in sector C is still alive.<br/> Plan your route accordingly and expect delays.<br/> We're not telling you what to do.<br/> We're just sharing how we feel.<br/> And now, weather.<br/> Is anyone else cold or is it just me? I am Marsha, ruler of Gazorpazorp.<br/> I am here if you need to talk.<br/> What is this place? Paradise.<br/> We built it during the great passive aggression, when females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior.<br/> - I'm here if you need to talk.<br/> - I'm here if you need to talk.<br/> From here we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population.<br/> Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery.<br/> The females are placed into educational program where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most.<br/> The males they get to play outside.<br/> That was just a baby.<br/> And within a day he'll be an adult male Gazorpian, one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe.<br/> Wait a minute.<br/> We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet.<br/> You speak when you're spoken to ding-a-ling.<br/> It's true though.<br/> One of your babies was born on earth.<br/> Are you the ruler of this earth? How did you know? - The quality of your top.<br/> - Do you love it? I love it.<br/> I'm here if you need to talk.<br/> I'm here if you need to talk.<br/> - I'm here if you need to talk.<br/> - I'm here if you need to talk.<br/> If the Gazorpian is male your earth is in grave danger.<br/> We will give you passage back home, so it can be terminated.<br/> But first, mojitos! We don't have time for mojitos! You are insulting them.<br/> I don't care Summer.<br/> This place is the worst! I wanna go home! Well, it really doesn't matter what you want because this is a sane place, where women rule.<br/> You know what I have to say about that? I can not believe my ears.<br/> Boy, who let the frogs out, huh? Grandpa! - Grandpa? - That sounds patriarchal.<br/> It means father of fathers.<br/> Then this one is not your slave and your earth is yet another planet dominated by men.<br/> It's not dominated by us, okay? On earth men and women are equals.<br/> Equals? We make 70% of your salary for the same job! Seize them! Was this really the time to make that point, Summer? This is for you Daddy.<br/> Oh man.<br/> Okay.<br/> Listen to me Morty Jr.<br/> I gotta tell you something very important, okay? Killing is bad.<br/> Bad.<br/> You are silly, Daddy.<br/> No, Morty Jr.<br/> I'm being serious, okay? You need to put your energy into something else.<br/> I mean what about dancing? Would you like to learn how to dance? I like to dance on the graves of my enemies.<br/> No, Morty Jr.<br/>! Daddy, can I go outside? No, absolutely not! But that's where all the people and the animals are.<br/> Yeah, but you can't go out there because The air is poisonous, for you! You will die if You'll die instantly if you ever leave this house.<br/> Do you hear me? - For real? - For real times a million, buddy.<br/> So let's just stay inside let's try dancing.<br/> Right? Look at me.<br/> We're gonna dance.<br/> Come on.<br/> Join, dance with me here.<br/> We love to dance.<br/> Why do we love to dance? Because I said so! - Nice.<br/> - Nice.<br/> So, what are you in for? Because I got a big you know penis between my legs.<br/> What are you in for? The worst crime a female can commit.<br/> Veronica Ann Bennett, I find you guilty of having bad bangs.<br/> You ever noticed the ones with bad bangs always have three names? You are hereby sentenced to the silent treatment! This is gonna be cake.<br/> No! Jackie! Rick and Summer of earth.<br/> For the crimes of treason against woman kind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist, you are hereby sentenced to What? A night on the couch? Death.<br/> I hate you so much right now.<br/> This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness.<br/> So we are forced to improvise.<br/> We placed a large boulder on that ledge.<br/> Holly shit! You're gonna crush us with a boulder?! No! Stop interrupting! The boulder falls onto a lever that will launch - Knives.<br/> - What?! Just give me a gun, I'll kill myself.<br/> Stop interrupting! The knives will Fine! You were right the first time, okay? The boulder crushes you.<br/> I just didn't want to admit you were right.<br/> - Happy?! - Just ignore them.<br/> - Ignore them.<br/> - Such an asshole.<br/> Look, I'm sorry, Summer.<br/> I feel bad that I let you drag us into this.<br/> I wish could have been a better grandpa to you.<br/> And you know, for what it's worth, that is a really nice cute top, that you're wearing there.<br/> Top? My top! My top! The same top you complimented earlier.<br/> Look! Look at the tag! Read it! It says Mark Jacobs.<br/> Mark? Jacob? These are names of the penis.<br/> Yes.<br/> An earth man made this top.<br/> Maybe on your planet separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on earth, a certain percentage of males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours.<br/> It's true.<br/> And sometimes the truth hurts.<br/> But it must be accepted.<br/> Like if I told you that you're using a wrong color foundation for your skin, and it ends at your neck making you look like a party clown.<br/> Okay.<br/> Ouch.<br/> Noted.<br/> But the fact remains if you impose Gazorpazorp's laws on earth you're no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute.<br/> Very well.<br/> Give the earth people spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet where women are kind of equal, but not really.<br/> Good job, Summer, and thanks girls.<br/> You girls are really something, I tell you that.<br/> You know, when we first got here - I was like - Give them a ship, now.<br/> Morty Jr.<br/>! Smoking?! That is not okay! What are you gonna do, ground me? I can't go outside anyway! So what? You could do things inside.<br/> You could play guitar, you could masturbate I don't wanna masturbate, I wanna conquer the planet! Oh, here we go again! Who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet Morty Jr.<br/>? Love.<br/> That's all you care about.<br/> What about weapons? What about domination of the enemy? Alright, that's it, no more History Chanel! This TV is for cartoons and video games only! I hate video games! You take that back! Give it to me! I didn't mean! I didn't mean that! I didn't mean to do that! I'm sorry! I can't take this anymore! I'd rather breath poison than living another minute with you! No! No, no, no! Stop! My life has been a lie! God is dead! The government's lame! Thanksgiving is about killing Indians! Jesus wasn't born on Christmas, they moved the date, it was a pagan holiday! - Oh, Dad! - Yes, Morty? My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive.<br/> Can you help me get him back? I suppose, Morty.<br/> I suppose.<br/> But first a deep sip from a very tall glass of ""I told you so"".<br/> Oh my god, please Dad, come on! Dad, there he is! Oh God.<br/> Hey stop that! Oh my god, oh my god, Dad! Morty Jr.<br/>, no! It's me.<br/> It's Dad.<br/> It's okay.<br/> Put the car down Morty Jr.<br/> No! Where's your hands? Where's your hands? My car!  And that's how we play handy hands.<br/>  - Out of the way, Morty! - No! Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creature in the universe.<br/> He's my son! And if you hurt him, you have to kill me, Rick! Dad, I'm so confused.<br/> I know Morty Jr.<br/> I'm sorry.<br/> I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me.<br/> You know parents are just kids having kids.<br/> One minute you like how a shiny robot looks, the next minute you're in a fist fight with your alien son.<br/> I'm an alien? We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts.<br/> We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive.<br/> But I want to murder everyone I see.<br/> Well you know, maybe there is a job out there for people that feel that way.<br/> Actually, there is.<br/> Hi, I'm Brad Anderson.<br/> Creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip ""Marmaduke"".<br/> You should consider being a creative.<br/> I'm hunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilation and sexual assaults on a nearly daily basis.<br/> But you know? I channeled it all into my work.<br/> I never got that impression from reading Marmaduke.<br/> Well, did you get the impression I was trying to make you laugh? Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson.<br/> See, you hear that, Morty Jr.<br/>? Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind.<br/> Maybe? I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel.<br/> I mean what I really wanna do is slit people's throat, but, beyond that.<br/> I know you can do it, son.<br/> I think it's time I get a place of my own.<br/> I promise I call you every day I need money or a place to do laundry.<br/> So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear Axel? Isn't it interesting Summer, that after all that stuff we just did nothing really mattered, there was no point to it.<br/> Kind of makes you wonder, huh? - About nothing - Are you sure it doesn't make you re-evaluate your policy about taking girls on adventure? No I'd say given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time, and any epiphanies about gender politics were projection of your feminine insecurity.<br/> But hey, why don't you have pink spaceship? Go ride around, and have a jolly old time.<br/> Maybe that'll shut you up.<br/> Dad? Summer? Where were you guys this whole time? On Gazorpazorp.<br/> Where were you? I was reading a newspaper.<br/> Oh, that's interesting, Beth.<br/> You know it's funny I heard about a little bit of news, myself.<br/> Take a look.<br/> Take a listen.<br/> This world still got a still got a chance!

Everyone thinks about it.<br/> Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it.<br/> - So you're welcome.<br/> - Yeah, you're welcome.<br/> Yeah, thank you guys so much.<br/> It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy.<br/> Hey, do we have any wafer cookies? Oh, boy.<br/> Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad.<br/> You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called ""Ball Fondlers"".<br/> I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse.<br/> - I'm in heaven right now.<br/> - This might be the best day of my life.<br/> So now what do we do? That show ""Ball Fondlers"" sounded kind of interesting.<br/> - Dad! - What? They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice.<br/> Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not.<br/> - We'll I'm leaving! - You can't leave, you're 17!

Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.<br/> No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music.<br/> In this reality, he's still alive.<br/> Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.<br/> He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters.<br/> Which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie.<br/> But then, when they made the movie Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp or Garfield, I mean.<br/> Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick.<br/> So all that happened in this reality too? I don't know.<br/> Just making conversation with you, Morty.<br/> What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything? Did you really talk me out of the abortion? Well, we we blew a tire on the way to the clinic.<br/> I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids.<br/> And now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise.<br/> What is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it.<br/> So we didn't do the kids any favors.<br/> So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves, or Or? Man.<br/> Woman.<br/> And now trunk men?

That's my grave.<br/> Wait, what? On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world.<br/> So we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one.<br/> Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed.<br/> And in this one, we were dead.<br/> So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves, and we took their place.<br/> And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast, own rotting corpse.<br/> So, you're not my brother?

Hey, Rick.<br/> I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend.<br/> - You think you could help me out? - Whatever.<br/> Well, I mean, traditionally, science fairs are a father-son thing.<br/> Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.<br/> Morty, I think it would be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad.<br/> Uh Yeah, dad.<br/> Why don't we do it together? Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son.<br/> We'll get out the crayons, brew some coffee, and knock this thing out in two or three days.<br/> - What is my purpose? - Pass the butter.<br/> Thank you.<br/> Dad, I need a ride to work.<br/> Maybe Rick can give you a ride.<br/> I'm helping Morty with science.<br/> I'm busy.<br/> Doing what? Uh, anything else.<br/> - What is my purpose? - You pass butter.<br/> Oh, my god.<br/> Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.<br/> Corrections by XhmikosR - Since when do you have a job? - Since last week.<br/> It's part-time at this little vintage thrift store.<br/> My boss is this really smart, eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me.<br/> Meow.<br/> Can't wait to meet this fascinating character.<br/> Please don't.<br/> Oh.<br/> Well, when did this stop being Jamba Juice?

Eh, I make my own stuff.<br/> So, what are you-- like, the devil? - What? Sorry? - I don't know.<br/> Store comes out of nowhere, all the shit's old and creepy.<br/> Are you the devil? A demon? - Leprechaun? - Grandpa Rick! Hey, I'm not judging.<br/> Just like shoot straight.<br/> I'm a man of science.<br/> Ah, then perhaps you could make use of this.<br/> This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension.<br/> Grandpa, go home and drink.<br/> Why don't we do a model of the solar system? That's what my dad did with me when I was your age.<br/> Oh, okay.<br/> You know, Rick's in his lab, making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science.<br/> A man and his boy, making planets.<br/> Hey, how about we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto? And then Jupiter -- Uh, actually, I don't think Pluto's a planet.<br/> Of course Pluto's a planet, son.<br/> I learned that in the third grade.<br/> Well, yeah, but you know they changed it.<br/> Morty, nobody changed the planets.<br/> I just googled it.<br/> Pluto's not a planet.<br/> They changed it in 2006.<br/> Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.<br/> - And I disagree.<br/> - You disagree? That's right.<br/> It's possible to disagree in science, Morty.<br/> Pluto was a planet.<br/> Some committee of fancy assholes disagree.<br/> I disagree back.<br/> Give me a ping-pong ball.<br/> Um, okay.<br/> I-I just have to Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto? No.<br/> Geez, I just got to go to the bathroom.<br/> Damn.<br/> Oh.<br/> Okay, good.<br/> This is gonna be fun.<br/> Hey, Morty, let me ask you a question real quick.<br/> Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it? Um Rhetorical question, Morty.<br/> The answer's ""yes, you just have to be a genius"".<br/> Cute.<br/> Your sister's boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.<br/> Ooh.<br/> Oh, boy, Rick.<br/> I'm don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know? Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled.<br/> I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded.<br/> Okay, yeah, but I don't think it's about logic, Rick.<br/> I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing.<br/> Well, that's retarded.<br/> What are you guys talking about? Apparently, nothing.<br/> You asked him if Pluto's a planet, didn't you? - No! - It's not.<br/> - Shut up, Rick.<br/> - Whoa.<br/> I don't care what anyone says.<br/> If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again.<br/> Planet.<br/> Planet, planet, planet.<br/> Stay scientific, Jerry.<br/> This aftershave made women want me, but it also made me impotent!

Ain't no game, sucka.<br/> Why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets? It's even easier.<br/> Sure, sure, and why don't we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn't always easy, Morty.<br/> - Whoa! - Whoa! What the hell?! I'm king Flippy Nips, ruler of Pluto.<br/> We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world.<br/> You really gave it to those guys at NASA.<br/> I was -- you know, sometimes science is about conviction.<br/> I'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.<br/> Oh, I Plutonians.<br/> Jerry Smith is a scientist from earth, where he's creating a model of our solar system.<br/> Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision.<br/> Um Pluto's a planet.<br/> Pluto's a [beep.]<br/> planet, bitch!

Let's just say you don't pay with money.<br/> That was perfect.<br/> You pay with the curses, right? Um I -- well But, mrs.<br/> Tate, why do you want cursed items? Well, I'm going to get the curses removed at ""Curse Purge Plus"".<br/> You know, the guy on TV? What? Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff from a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but [beep.]<br/> with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to ""Curse Purge Plus"".<br/> I use science to un-curse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers.<br/> This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster, but guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless.<br/> I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I don't know, $8 million.<br/> See you at the olympics.<br/> This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family.<br/> Now it does their taxes.<br/> Everything's deductible.<br/> Don't pay for cool stuff with your soul.<br/> Pay for it with money.<br/> You know, like how every other store in the world works? We're located at First and Main in old town.<br/> Come on -- come on down.<br/> ""First and"" That's right across the street from ""Needful Things,"" where you can get evil items for free! Diabolic son of a motherf-- We're back on ""Good morning, Pluto.<br/>"" And a very good morning it is for our guest, earth scientist Jerry Smith, who's making headlines with his bold announcement that is what, Jerry? Pluto is a planet.<br/> - Well, how about that.<br/> - I love it.<br/> Morty Smith.<br/> I'm Scroopy Noopers.<br/> I'm a scientist.<br/> - Can I show you something? - Uh, I better not.<br/> Right now.<br/> The center of Pluto, mr.<br/> Smith, is made of a substance called ""Plutonium"".<br/> Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers.<br/> And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks.<br/> There it goes again.<br/> Just shrank a little.<br/> But a few years ago, your scientists noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn't even call it a ""planet"" anymore.<br/> Should've been our wake-up call.<br/> But the rich Plutonians won't wake up, and they love your dad telling everyone Pluto's a planet because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally Um, a party? Is everyone in your family an idiot? Well, for sure me and my dad are.<br/> Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives.<br/> Yeah, you know, the thing is my dad's really insecure.<br/> Hmm.<br/> Funny.<br/> Mr.<br/> Needful, out of everything in the store, you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of.<br/> Oh, my god.<br/> Oh, my god.<br/> I wish this desk was lighter.<br/> I wish this knot was looser.<br/> Come on.<br/> I don't -- Wait, what am I doing? I wish I knew CPR.<br/> Oh, Jesus.<br/> What a waste of a monkey paw.<br/> Mr.<br/> Needful, how could you even think of doing something so horrible? I'm the devil.<br/> What should I do when I fail -- get myself an ice cream? You haven't failed.<br/> People like Rick are making me obsolete.<br/> I mean, seriously.<br/> I may be ""the devil"", but your grandpa is the devil.<br/> I just want to go back to hell, where everyone thinks I'm smart and funny.<br/> No! It's not fair.<br/> Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you -- even Rick.<br/> I was your only friend, and I get nothing? Okay.<br/> I'll give you one thing.<br/> - Name it.<br/> - I want to help you.<br/> Clever twist.<br/> I learned from the best, you old fart.<br/> Now, let's go get you hydrated.<br/> Looks like we've got haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936, and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity.<br/> I can take out the ""eternity"" and the padding, and then you'll have some time-traveling mittens.<br/> Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby.<br/> - How's business? - Here's the last of our inventory.<br/> We're going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring.<br/> Sounds like code for ""you win, Rick.<br/>"" That was important to you, wasn't it? Nope.<br/> It was important to your dumb devil friend.<br/> To me, this was all just a bit, like when bugs bunny [beep.]<br/> with the opera singer for 20 minutes.<br/> He tried to kill himself.<br/> Seriously? Holy crap.<br/> Holy crap.<br/> But you know what, grandpa Rick? He's strong, and he's never going to give up.<br/> Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.<br/> Oh, I know.<br/> Everyone knows you don't care.<br/> So? So have fun not caring.<br/> - I always do.<br/> - Good.<br/> Yeah, it is good.<br/> It's the best.<br/> I'm sure it is.<br/> - Bye.<br/> - Later.<br/> I'm here to pick up my undead cat and child.<br/> Yeah, uh Give me a sec.<br/> These are the forms for the employee health plan.<br/> All right, yeah, put -- put them on my Eh.<br/> I just got bored.<br/> Everybody out.<br/> All right, just one more rally, then I promise we'll get back to your science project.<br/> Dad, Pluto isn't a planet.<br/> It's shrinking because of corporations.<br/> Yeah, that's what that anti-planet nut job Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the ministry of money's fundraiser.<br/> Are you telling me four billion Plutonians are wrong? You said science wasn't easy.<br/> I said science isn't always easy.<br/> Obviously, that means sometimes it is easy.<br/> Let's not debase ourselves with word games, son.<br/> Dad, their whole planet is dying.<br/> Ha! You called it a planet.<br/> Checkmate.<br/> What's up, Pluto? Mr.<br/> Smith, please tell my friend here what you just told me.<br/> Go on.<br/> My very eager mother just served us nine pickles, and the ""pickles"" is Pluto.<br/> My god, the man's a genius.<br/> Um, excuse me.<br/> Morty, what? Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto science reader linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes, and surface shrinkage to deep-core Plutonium drilling? Well, son, what did you think when you were 5 and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage? I mean, I'm trimming the hedges, and these things are just hanging there.<br/> Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them? Good one, dad.<br/> Hey, Morty, you want to go on a Oh.<br/> Hey, Beth.<br/> Hello? Hey, Jerry, you in here being stupid? Thanks.<br/> Hey, you know, I was thinking, you know, I might watch a movie.<br/> I am not programmed for friendship.<br/> Suit yourself.<br/> Hey.<br/> Hey.<br/> W-w-what's going on? Um, listen, can you help me do the stupid science fair project? Whatever.<br/> Jerry, you must be so excited.<br/> The Pluto-bel prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive.<br/> I'm flattered and humbled.<br/> Oh, I like that.<br/> Use that in your speech.<br/> Also, talk about Pluto being a planet.<br/> People like that.<br/> Your highness, we've captured Scroopy Noopers.<br/> You animals! Animals! Ooh, look who's little journey's come to an end.<br/> Take him to Pluto-namo bay.<br/> You can't kill the truth, father.<br/> What? I can see you're confused.<br/> Pluto-namo bay is a military prison-- a sort of play on words.<br/> Did he call you ""father""? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nut job, is your son? The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry.<br/> Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf.<br/> It's a what? Huh? Oh, planet.<br/> ""Pluto is a cold, cold planet"".<br/> That's what I meant.<br/> Knock them dead out there, you.<br/> Pluto is Not a planet.<br/> Ow! It's not a planet.<br/> Hey! It's not a planet! I'm an idiot, and I love my son.<br/> It was a long six hours, but we've overhauled ""Needful Things"" into the globally-compliant web 4.<br/>0, ""e-nomenon"", ""n33dful.<br/>com"", spelled with threes instead of ""e""'s.<br/> - Whoo, yeah! - Whoo, excited! Okay, that's it.<br/> We just got bought by Google! Mm.<br/> I'm so proud of you, Lucius.<br/> So, how much did we make? ""We"".<br/> This is my business.<br/> Security! You're Zuckerberg-ing me? I was Zuckerberg-ing people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped.<br/> I'm the devil, bitch! What, what?! Hey! Hey! - Hey, Morty.<br/> - Oh, oh, hey, dad.<br/> Um, what -- what are you doing back from Pluto so quick? Uh Some people just can't handle the truth.<br/> Especially dummies like me.<br/> Morty, I'm not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again.<br/> Hey, dad.<br/> Nobody's smarter than Rick, but nobody else is my dad.<br/> You're a genius at that.<br/> Wow.<br/> That's humbling and flattering, son.<br/> Thank you.<br/> What say we finish ourselves an eight-planet solar system? Um I'm just gonna take this thing in and get an ""A"".<br/> Butter.<br/> But You're a genius at being my dad, dad.<br/> Quit while you're ahead.<br/> And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I'm sitting in here, I'm 14 -- I got a computer in here, you know? Oh, I -- I think I understand.<br/> You're really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man.<br/> I get it.<br/> Say no more.<br/> I mean, one of these days, you know, you're gonna end up seeing something.<br/> I got it! Noted.<br/> Good night.<br/> How's your pretend grandpa doing, aka ""the devil""? He dumped me.<br/> Oof.<br/> Sorry.<br/> Did we learn a lesson here I'm not seeing? Not sure.<br/> Maybe in a much bigger way, mr.<br/> Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty, and you didn't realize how much you valued my approval? - No, that's dumb.<br/> - Yeah, not satisfying.<br/> I'll tell you what, though.<br/> If -- if -- if it's satisfaction you're after, I think I might have an idea.<br/> Uh-huh.<br/> Uh-huh, totally.<br/> Let's do it.<br/>  X gonna give it to ya what?   Wait for you to get it on your own,   X gonna deliver to ya   knock knock, open up the door, it's real   with the non-stop pop pop and stainless steel   go hard, getting busy with it   but I got such a good heart   that I'll make the mother wonder if he did it   damn right, and I'll do it again,   'cause I am right so I gots to win   break bread with the enemy   but no matter how many cats I break bread with   I'll break who you --  And that's how I took my storefront into the forefront of the up front.<br/> Thank you, Seattle.<br/> Rick? Summer? Stupid mother [beep.]<br/>.<br/> You stupid bitch.<br/> How do you like that? W-w-why? Because sometimes what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price.<br/> - We did it.<br/> - Yeah, bro.<br/> We totally worked it.<br/> - Yeah.<br/> - We just pulled it off.<br/> Yeah, bro.<br/> Yeah.<br/>  Bitch, please, if the only thing you cats did was came out to play   stay out my way, mother--   first we gonna rock, then we gonna roll   then we let it pop, don't let it go   X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya   X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya   first we gonna rock, then we gonna roll   then we let it pop, don't let it go   X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya   X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya   ain't never gave nothing to me  Corrections by XhmikosR   <br/>

Hurry up, Morty.<br/> Grandpa's about to un-freeze time.<br/> You really should be cleaning from top to bottom.<br/> I know how to vacuum mom and dad, Summer.<br/> I've been doing it for six months.<br/> Then you've been doing it wrong for six months.<br/> Oh, my God, is that mildew? It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day.<br/> You have dropped so many balls, man.<br/> Do you ever get scared grandpa Rick might make me his new sidekick? - What?! What kind of monster are you? - A competent one.<br/> Who cares about the things you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time was to stop giving a [bleep.]<br/>.<br/> Put a shirt on your dumb dad, and let's get this dumb universe rolling.<br/> Let's do this thing.<br/> All right, listen, you two.<br/> We froze time for a pretty long time, so when I un-freeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.<br/> Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean? It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty.<br/> Uh, I thought you learned that by now.<br/> It also means don't touch your parents, or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.<br/> - Wait a minute, what? - And away we go!  Um did we ever put that mattress under Mr.<br/> Benson? - Shhh.<br/> - Shush, Morty.<br/> A thing or two about Wait, what? Was the house When we pulled up, I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.<br/> Negative visualization, Jerry.<br/> Explains a lot about where you're at.<br/> - Hi, sweetie.<br/> - Hi, dad.<br/> Summer, Morty, are you okay? - We we just missed you a lot.<br/> - Yeah, we missed you so much.<br/> Too much to hug you, though.<br/> Yeah, it would literally destroy them.<br/> Now, listen, why don't Why don't Why don't you guys go get a free Sunday ice cream? Get out there and get some ice creams.<br/> Here's $500 cash in unmarked monies.<br/> I'm just gonna put it on the floor and kick it on over to ya.<br/> - You guys go nuts.<br/> - This better not be a bribe.<br/> If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you.<br/> I'll get my jacket.<br/> Sweetie, is your shirt on backwards? Yeah.<br/> I like it this way.<br/> I'm not stupid.<br/> - Phew! - Oh.<br/> Man, that guy is the Redgren Grumbholdt of pretending he knows what's going on.<br/> - Oh, you agree, huh? - It's funny.<br/> You like that Redgren Grumbholdt reference? - Yeah.<br/> - Well, guess what? I made him up.<br/> You really are your father's children.<br/> Think for yourselves.<br/> Don't be sheep.<br/> God, I feel terrible.<br/> Yep, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.<br/> One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam! Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under Uh, what? It was your job, Morty.<br/> - Nuh-uh! - Yuh-huh! Actually, sorry, Summer.<br/> I got to back the ""m"" bomb on this one.<br/> I remember the conversation.<br/> We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies.<br/> Your job was to put the mattress under Mr.<br/> Benson.<br/> Boom! In your face, Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.<br/> Shut up, Morty, you vindictive little turd! You shut up, you big female asshole! Hey, don't shove me! - I didn't! - You didn't what? - What's your problem? - What's yours? - Shut up! - You shut up! Wh-whoa, whoa! What the hell, hell, hell, hell, hell? Oh, God.<br/> Oh, no.<br/> What did you guys just do? - What did who do? - What do you mean? - Wait, what am I saying? - Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now? Oh, man, I don't feel good.<br/> - Am I me? - Am I talking right now? - I think so.<br/> - Wait, who said that? All right, both of you just don't move.<br/> Don't speak, don't think.<br/> I have to check something.<br/> - What'd you do, Morty? - I'm gonna help grandpa.<br/> What do you mean you're gonna help him? I can help, too.<br/> - What's happening, grandpa? - What's going on, Rick? Sh-sh-shut up.<br/> Oh, crap, are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot.<br/> The two of you made us uncertain! - What are you talking about? - What's that mean? - English, please.<br/> - English? Our time is fractured You two somehow created a feedback look of uncertainty that split our reality into two equally possible impossibilities.<br/> W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker.<br/> We're entirely hypothetical.<br/> But I thought there were infinite time lines? We're not on any time line, dummy.<br/> Look.<br/> Oh, my God! Are those cats? I assume they're SchrÃ dinger's cats.<br/> Or, actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.<br/> - Is the world gone? - Is the world gone? - Where are mom and dad? - What about mom and dad? Mom and dad? Get your head out of your family's ass.<br/> The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion.<br/> Your parents get to exist.<br/> They're probably living it up in some pointless, grounded story about their [bleep.]<br/> marriage.<br/> Cold stone creamery is the best.<br/> What should we do with our remaining $20? You realize they sing no matter how much you tip? - Whoa! - Aaah! Holy [bleep.]<br/>! - What happened? - I hit a deer.<br/> We we have to tell the cops you were driving.<br/> - What? - This is rum raisin! - It's still alive.<br/> - Well, do we Do I, uh, get, uh, a big rock, or? It's not an armadillo, asshole.<br/> I thought that's what a man's supposed to say.<br/> It's not like I could've actually done it.<br/> If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I I think we have to just It's okay.<br/> This is just something that happens.<br/> And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do? You're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.<br/> So? Well, don't different animals Require different levels of skill to keep alive? - Oh, God.<br/> - Get the deer in the car, Jerry.<br/> Yes, Beth.<br/> This is why you don't freeze time, you guys.<br/> It's incredibly irresponsible.<br/> And you did it so we could clean the house after a party? Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty.<br/> Like, literally no time.<br/> Look around.<br/> Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable.<br/> Eventually, everything either is or isn't.<br/> And we've got about four hours to be ""is"".<br/> - Or? - We isn't.<br/> All right, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.<br/> - How do you know - How do you know that Whatever your asking me, the answer is I'm amazing.<br/> And away we go.<br/> Huh, what do you know.<br/> It's working.<br/> - Ow, ow, ow! - Oh [bleep.]<br/>.<br/> What the hell is wrong with you two? I-I-I-I mean you four! That hurt! That was painful.<br/> Good, I'm glad it was painful.<br/> You deserve it.<br/> I saw you.<br/> Y-you're both all over the damn place.<br/> We've been split for 20 minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum [bleep.]<br/> wind? What the hell do either of you two have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? - Come on, spit it out! - Well, you don't exactly make it easy, Rick.<br/> You make fun of me all the time You're always picking on me And now Summer's doing it and now you got Summer to kiss your ass.<br/> Me?! What about you? You're just as mean to me because you're jealous Could you get more excited to see me fail? Because you want grandpa all to yourself! All right, all right, cool it.<br/> I see what's happening here.<br/> You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, and you both want to be grandpa's favorite.<br/> I can fix this.<br/> Morty, sit here.<br/> Summer, you sit here.<br/> Now, listen.<br/> I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit.<br/> Yeah.<br/> I can prove it mathematically.<br/> Actually, let me grab my white board.<br/> This has been a long time coming, anyway.<br/> Emergency! Wounded deer coming in.<br/> Three.<br/> Excuse me, you can't be back here.<br/> I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention.<br/> - Nurse, please move that snake.<br/> - That's my nurse.<br/> And as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs.<br/> As a vet, I'm sure you know that a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor.<br/> So let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out.<br/> - It's time to save a life! - Geez.<br/> That's odd.<br/> This deer's wounded.<br/> Uh, yeah, I was there.<br/> You don't have to rub it in.<br/> I mean it's been shot with a gun.<br/> My gun.<br/> May I help you, sir? No, but you can stop helping this deer.<br/> I shot it before these two hit it with their car, and I followed them when they hauled it off.<br/> This deer belongs to me.<br/> We don't have time for this, okay? I need anaesthetic and deer saline.<br/> Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm.<br/> Except when sterilizing, aborting, or euthanizing them, or also when eating them at also any meal.<br/> I'm calling my lawyer.<br/> I hope for all our sakes you're as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.<br/> In your dreams, bitch.<br/> Scalpel.<br/> So, in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy, hysterical, bird-brained homunculi.<br/> And I honestly can't even tell the two of you apart half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical.<br/> All right, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world.<br/> - Yes.<br/> - Yes.<br/> All right, perfect.<br/> Sit still.<br/> Arms down.<br/> I'm gonna do this again.<br/> This time be like grandpa.<br/> You mean drunk? What's that? You got something to say? - No.<br/> - And away we go! And away we go! - Huh, that's weird.<br/> - Huh, that's weird.<br/> - Oh, my God.<br/> - What? - Oh, my God.<br/> - What? - The son of a bitch is gonna kill me! - What?! - The son of a bitch is gonna kill me! - What?! Diabolical, unfeeling sociopath.<br/> - Don't you get it?! - Don't you get it?! The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore.<br/> He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me.<br/> He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them.<br/> I have to admit, it was always in the back of my mind, too.<br/> The difference is I would never do it, until now.<br/> - Rick, what the hell are you doing? - Saving our lives! After he takes me out, he's He's gonna be coming for you.<br/> - Who? - Me! Aah! - Whoa! - You see that? Get down! I told you, he's a psycho.<br/> He's lost it! Th-th-th-the time fracture must have made him crazy! - I don't know what to do! - Oh, crap! I don't know what to do! Oh, God, now there's three of them.<br/> We're outnumbered.<br/> Get in the cupboards.<br/> Wait, don't don't do that.<br/> They'll know.<br/> Wait, wait.<br/> Think about getting in the cupboards, but don't really.<br/> Is this what you want, you sick [bleep.]<br/>?! You want to see children die?! You son of a bitch.<br/> You don't stop living until I say so! Michael.<br/> - Who's this now? - My lawyer.<br/> I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies.<br/> It's called Brad's law.<br/> We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point, you're performing it on venison.<br/> Actually, I've decided not to eat it.<br/> All this fear and conflict I'm sure it's ruined the meat.<br/> I'm just gonna use the head for my rec-room wall.<br/> She normally works on horses.<br/> Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the [bleep.]<br/> out of here.<br/> I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back! Jesus.<br/> Shh, shh! I know where you are, you creepy old monster.<br/> I know how you think.<br/> Oh, is there where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well, maybe you're right.<br/> Holy [bleep.]<br/> now what? Well, if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized? - Right.<br/> - Okay.<br/> So, from now on, whatever we do, we have to be certain.<br/> Right.<br/> I think I'm certain we're effed in the ""a"".<br/> Oh, God, my head.<br/> What did you guys do? We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy and you caused another time fracture.<br/> You tried to kill yourself.<br/> O-only in self-defense.<br/> Myself tried to kill me first.<br/> Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it.<br/> Well, actually, I do expect you to understand that.<br/> It's basic math.<br/> C-can somebody just let me out of here? If I die in a cage, I lose a bet.<br/> Well, is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore? Oh, for God's sake.<br/> All right, here.<br/> - Give me the time crystal.<br/> - Wh-what are you doing? Calling myself.<br/> Here, listen.<br/> It'll probably go to voice-mail since, you know, I'm calling myself.<br/> - Hello, Rick here.<br/> - Don't fall for it.<br/> It's a bit.<br/> Just kidding! Ha, ha! You just got ricked.<br/> - You've reached Rick's voice-mail.<br/> - You know what to do.<br/> Hey, Rick.<br/> It's Rick.<br/> Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.<br/> No hard feelings.<br/> I know you know I mean it, too.<br/> Take it easy.<br/> Whoa, damn! Look at this.<br/> I'm blowing up Three new voicemails.<br/> Hey, Rick.<br/> It's Rick.<br/> Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.<br/> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br/> I heard this one.<br/> Hey, Rick.<br/> It's Rick.<br/> Hey, Rick, it's You get the idea.<br/> W-we're cool now.<br/> Okay, well, we're still not gonna let you out of this crate.<br/> Fine.<br/> I'll just do it myself.<br/> If you could get out that whole time, why didn't you? Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty.<br/> That's the difference between you and me.<br/> I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.<br/> You know, geez, Rick! Y-y-you're really tearing into me right now.<br/> You know, words hurt.<br/> - Holy! - A monster! Hey, you hey, quit yelling.<br/> Quit yelling.<br/> What the [bleep.]<br/> Your time is all ripped up to hell! You broke your time twice.<br/> How did this happen? Shut the [bleep.]<br/> up.<br/> Oh, damn.<br/> I'm from the fourth dimension.<br/> I can hear all of y'all.<br/> Now let's just see what we got here for a second.<br/> Hey, damn it.<br/> Were you trying to use this to Oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you're standing in it, you dumb-ass three-dimensional monkey-ass dummies? Oh, way to go, Rick.<br/> Yeah, grandpa, way to go.<br/> What, you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head.<br/> He came here in a bubble.<br/> For all we know, he could be the David Berkowitz of nutsackland.<br/> Shut up.<br/> Here, put these on.<br/> They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time.<br/> Y'all are just Just just negligent.<br/> See, now Now look right here.<br/> Hey, hey, hey, the three of you, put your collars on.<br/> - We have them on.<br/> - What are you talking about? - Uh, we did.<br/> - We're not wearing collars.<br/> Exactly.<br/> 'Cause you're being obstinate.<br/> What? Put the damn collars on if you want to live.<br/> - They're on right now.<br/> - We did.<br/> They're on.<br/> All right, fine.<br/> Summer, Morty, put them on.<br/> - Yes, we're back! - No more cats! - We're back in certain time.<br/> - Problem solved.<br/> No more cats! Oh, you did it! - You fixed it.<br/> - Yeah, I did.<br/> Now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak-ass time again.<br/> How long, exactly, do we have to wear these things? They're really embarrassing.<br/> Well, since you're going to time prison, I'd say you can keep them on forever.<br/> - Time prison? - Yeah.<br/> Well, I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way your dumb-ass assin' ass asses could ever have on is if it was stolen.<br/> You stole a time-freezing crystal from testicle monsters?! I would've been happy to pay for it, s Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco.<br/> Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here.<br/> Get him! No, no, no, no! You better keep back! Man, this will turn your ass into a third-trimester fetus from 30 yards.<br/> Mm.<br/> Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure? That's right, Mrs.<br/> Smith.<br/> Give in to your anger.<br/> Neglect that deer.<br/> Honey, it's gonna be okay.<br/> These men are from the Cervine Institute of elk, moose, deer, and stag.<br/> They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border.<br/> Where your jurisdiction ends.<br/> I guess that's the end of that.<br/> There is just one more thing.<br/> According to this state's veterinarian statute, this animal can't be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care.<br/> You heard the man, horse doctor.<br/> You have to say you couldn't hack it.<br/> We did it! Uh-huh.<br/> No, mother no.<br/> Earth, dude.<br/> No, I'm talking about Yeah, with the dinosaurs.<br/> No, if you get to the dolphin people, you gone too far.<br/> All right, man, I'll talk to you later.<br/> Okay.<br/> You know what they do to third-dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever.<br/> Why are you doing this? You think I want to be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions, man.<br/> Bringing you guys in is my ticket up.<br/> What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you? - You really think I'm that stupid? - All right, hear me out on this.<br/> You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite.<br/> Okay, well, then that means there's a 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.<br/> I cannot argue that.<br/> Aaah! Oh, God, gross and weird! Chris! You killed my gun! Summer, Morty, take off your collars.<br/> - What? - What the hell are you doing? Good question.<br/> I suppose the answer is I'm not certain.<br/> Oh, no, what are you doing? - I have no idea.<br/> - I'm not sure.<br/> Stop it! Maybe I will, maybe I won't.<br/> I'm really uncertain about everything, even kicking your ass.<br/> List hey! Tw ow! But these arms are vestigial! Now, you poked me where an eye would've been about 6 million years ago.<br/> Come on, let's help grandpa.<br/> Yes! I'm 100% not sure about anything! Yeah, totally uncertain.<br/> Beat his ass! Get him! Beat him up! - Kick his ass, Rick! - Die, mother[bleep.]<br/>! Ow! I'm defeated.<br/> - What's happening? - Time is falling apart.<br/> We've got to get back to certainty quick.<br/> Give me your collars.<br/> Oh, man.<br/> Don't you have to fix, like, 30 of them? Morty, I have to fix three of them.<br/> And then there's 31 other versions of me that have to also fix three, for a total of 96.<br/> I'm not an idiot.<br/> I know how to be decisive.<br/> - Now hand me that flat-head screwdriver.<br/> - Now hand me that Phillips screwdriver.<br/> - Actually, make it a flat-head.<br/> - Actually, make it a Phillips.<br/> Oh, shit.<br/> Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today.<br/> I know it's my fault we hit the deer.<br/> And I know you wanted to be the one to save it.<br/> Whatever.<br/> How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego? Well, you'd have to be pretty petty.<br/> But you'd still be the woman I married.<br/> Where are we going? One last stop.<br/> Where's the helicopter? There is no helicopter.<br/> And there is no Cervine Institute.<br/> But the top deer surgeon I'm looking at her.<br/> Thanks for teeing me up like that.<br/> You better get moving.<br/> These lights are designed for basic ice-cream work.<br/> They're not gonna last all night.<br/> I need five minutes.<br/> Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had.<br/> Thanks to cold stone creamery.<br/> You're welcome.<br/> Okay, collars are done.<br/> Put them on.<br/> We're out of time.<br/> It's ironic, huh? Huh? Wait a minute.<br/> - Great.<br/> - Rick! What's going on? The collar.<br/> Oh, the latch is broken.<br/> It won't latch closed around my neck.<br/> - Oh, are you kidding me? - Geez, what's going on? How come our collars aren't green? Obviously because someone doesn't know how to put his collar on, and one of me is stuck trying to help him.<br/> Don't blame this on me.<br/> You're the one that couldn't fix a latch.<br/> What are you talking about? It's not broken, Morty.<br/> I fixed it.<br/> Just put it on.<br/> It won't close.<br/> It's broken.<br/> Fine, bring it here.<br/> Oh! - Rick! - Morty! Oh, really, Morty? Well, I'm sorry.<br/> I'm not the one who's so [bleep.]<br/> uncertain about everything.<br/> You know what I'm certain of, Rick? I've really made up my mind about this.<br/> I never want to see you again! You're never gonna see anything again, you little dummy! You killed us! God damn it.<br/>  Rick! Oh! Morty, where's your collar? I'll fix it.<br/> I dropped it.<br/> What the hell? What have you done to me, Morty? I'm okay with this.<br/> Be good, Morty.<br/> Be better than me.<br/> Oh [bleep.]<br/> the other collar! I'm not okay with this.<br/> I am not okay with this! Oh, sweet Jesus, please let me live.<br/> Oh, my God, I have to I've got to fix this thing.<br/> Please, God in heaven.<br/> Please, God.<br/> Oh, lord, hear my prayers.<br/> Yes! [Bleep.]<br/> you, God! Not today, bitch! Please, God, if there's a hell, please be merciful to me.<br/> Yes, I did it! There is no God! In your face! One dot, mother[bleep.]<br/>! - Yes! - Oh, yes! All right, you know what I'm talking about.<br/> - Oh, that was a close call.<br/> - Oh, yeah! I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty.<br/> - Oh, yeah, do it.<br/> - Check me out.<br/> I'm doing the cabbage patch.<br/> - Do it right.<br/> - I'm doing it, too.<br/> - Do the cabbage patch.<br/> - It's a classic dance.<br/> - Do it.<br/> Do the dance.<br/> - Oh [bleep.]<br/> look at that.<br/> Hey, wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here? I don't know.<br/> I think, like, It's hard to keep straight now that I have 63 other memories of everything.<br/> Yeah.<br/> But I feel like one of the 64 Ricks, like, sacrificed himself for me? - Maybe? I think? - Shut up, Morty.<br/> The last time you felt something, we all almost died.<br/> You little piece of shit.<br/> Hey, guys, we're home.<br/> Mom! Dad! Uh, hold the phone.<br/> Where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three.<br/> Am I right? Are you guys Power Rangers, but only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Cleanup in the fruit aisle.<br/> Not in a homophobic way, though.<br/> They're just fruity necklaces is what I was saying.<br/> I'm gonna pee my pants! - Somebody call the planet of ""tron""! - Doesn't feel so good, does it? - We have three ""tron"" people over here.<br/> - No, it doesn't.<br/> It hurts.<br/> Seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles with green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame.<br/> Are those chokers from the '90s? What is this, a '90s nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie ""The Craft"" with Fairuza Balk? Hey, man, when the hell were you? - Looking for you, asshole.<br/> - I told you past the dinosaurs.<br/> You know how much time is past the dinosaurs? Half of all time! Come on, man.<br/> It's this way.<br/> - Come on.<br/> - Give me that thing.<br/> Speed it up.<br/> He can't be this far back.<br/> No, no, there he is.<br/> There he is.<br/> There he is.<br/> There he is.<br/> Stop, stop.<br/> - So, that's the guy, huh? - Yeah, that's him.<br/> Hey, man.<br/> Remember me? I got something for your ass.<br/> Don't mess with time! You don't [bleep.]<br/> with time! Mother[bleep.]<br/>! I will mess with time.<br/> I will mess with time.<br/> Did you get any of that? It's a good show.<br/> <br/>

Learning to fly this thing, Morty, is gonna be really liberating.<br/> You know, you're gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me.<br/> - Cool.<br/> - See that planet right there? Don't fly too close to that planet.<br/> Someone will come out and try to wash your windshield.<br/> Hold on.<br/> Yeah? Yeah, I have it.<br/> Where do you want to meet? All right, cool.<br/> All right, Morty, lesson's over.<br/> We got some business to attend to a few light minutes south of here.<br/> Oh, you still use south in space? Whoa! Jesus, Jerry! What the hell are you doing here?! What are you talking about? We agreed a boy's father should be present - when he's learning to drive.<br/> - I guess I remember that.<br/> Wow.<br/> And you've just been back there this whole time? Amazing.<br/> Well, we don't have time to take him to earth, Morty.<br/> Head for 3924917.<br/> Cool! Looks like I'm coming along for an adventure! Yep.<br/> - This is where we're going? - Nope.<br/> This is.<br/> You can park in a handicap spot, Morty.<br/> Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here.<br/> Well, look at this fella.<br/> Aren't you handsome? Thank you.<br/> - I'm Jerry.<br/> - Oh, I know you are.<br/> Did you come here in a spaceship? I'm traveling with my son and father-in-law.<br/> W-wait.<br/> Are they coming? Oh, they'll be back soon.<br/> What?! I don't know how this works! Help me! What the hell?! I know, right? Oh, what the hell?! I know, right? Jerryboree!? You created a day care for my dad? Are you kidding? I wish I had this idea.<br/> Well, I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it.<br/> That guy's rich.<br/> Don't forget to check the reason for your drop-off.<br/> Trust me, Morty, I've heard stories from other Ricks.<br/> Jerrys don't tend to last five minutes off of earth.<br/> This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid.<br/> Here, they can romp and play with other Jerrys.<br/> He couldn't be safer.<br/> Hey, Morty, hang on to this.<br/> That number's your dad.<br/> If you lose it, we're not gonna be able to get him back.<br/>   - Okay, wait here.<br/> - I want to come with.<br/> Don't come with.<br/> It's boring.<br/> It's it's business stuff.<br/> What kind of business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady.<br/> Right, yeah, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street, Morty? Y-you know what those guys do in their fancy boardrooms? They take their balls and they dip them in cocaine and wipe them all over each other.<br/> You know, grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public, because grandpa isn't shady.<br/> Aw, crap.<br/> Hey, what's up? Hey, Rick! Here you go 3,000 flerbos.<br/> Do you have the weapon? C-can we please? This is my grandson, Morty.<br/> Oh, hi, Morty.<br/> I'm Krombopulos Michael.<br/> I'm an assassin.<br/> I buy guns from your grandpa.<br/> Here.<br/> Go away.<br/> Ooh! Yeah, this looks deadly.<br/> So, this shoots antimatter? My target can't be killed with regular matter.<br/> Nice to meet you, Morty.<br/> Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered, please give me a call.<br/> - I'm very discreet.<br/> - You're g-giving him a card?! I have no code of ethics.<br/> I will kill anyone, anywhere children, animals, old people doesn't matter.<br/> I just love killing.<br/> You sell weapons to killers for money? You've got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mind-set, Morty.<br/> It's more complicated out here.<br/> These are flerbos.<br/> Do you understand what two humans can accomplish - with 3,000 of these? - Uh, what? An entire afternoon at Blips and Chitz! Oh, this place is the best.<br/> It's got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.<br/> You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?! Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad, Morty.<br/> Here, check this out.<br/> Aah! Roy, what's wrong? I had a nightmare.<br/> I was with an old man.<br/> He put a helmet on me.<br/> It's just a fever.<br/> Get some sleep.<br/> I don't want you missing school on Monday.<br/> I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future.<br/> Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.<br/> Spiraling perfectly! It's gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20! Now he's at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy ""the Rocket""! Touchdown! I just think it's time to get realistic.<br/> Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy? Had we caught it sooner well, hindsight is 20/20, Roy.<br/> What's important is that we move quickly.<br/> I'm not ready to die.<br/> You're not going to.<br/> - Yeah! Whoo! - Yeah! Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy.<br/> Hey, Roy, you pulled those persian off-white shags for the clearance sale? Whoa.<br/> Sh shit! Oh! Whoa! What the hell?! W-w-where am I?! - What in the hell?! - 55 years.<br/> Not bad, Morty.<br/> You kind of wasted your 30s, though, with that whole bird-watching phase.<br/> - Where's my wife?! - Morty, you were just playing a game.<br/> It's called ""Roy"".<br/> Snap out of it.<br/> Come on.<br/> I'm Morty.<br/> You're Rick.<br/> Hey! You sold a gun to a guy that kills people! Look at this you beat cancer, and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo! D-don't dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hit man is the same as pulling the trigger! It's also the same as doing nothing.<br/> If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there's not a lot anyone can do to stop him.<br/> That's why he does it for a living.<br/> Now excuse me.<br/> It's time to thrash your ""Roy"" score.<br/> You know, you could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted.<br/> Uh-huh, yeah, that's the difference between you and me, Morty.<br/> - I never go back to the carpet store.<br/> - Holy shit! This guy's taking Roy off the grid! This guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy! Hi.<br/> I'm sorry.<br/> I think there was a misunderstanding.<br/> I'm an adult and would like to go home, please.<br/> Well, of course.<br/> Right through that tube.<br/> Unbelievable.<br/> You're doing great.<br/> I know how to crawl in a tube.<br/> Come on.<br/> Oh.<br/> This is harder than it looks.<br/> Whoa! - Marco? - Polo! Marco? Come find me.<br/> Marco? You guys are enjoying this? Don't you feel a little patronized? How so? - Jerry! - Beth.<br/> Oh, come on.<br/> This is ridiculous.<br/> I love you, Jerry.<br/> Aw, Beth.<br/> Who wants to come watch ""midnight run"" with director's commentary on? - Yeah! - Definitely.<br/> First one there gets to adjust the picture setting! The factory tint setting is always too high! Out of my way.<br/> The tint setting is always too high.<br/>  Oh, boy.<br/> Here I go killing again.<br/> Aah! Aah! Arh! Aah! Aah! You have arrived at Krombopulos Michael.<br/> Your destination is below.<br/> We're all out of off-white Persian.<br/> Oh, man! W-w-what have I done?! - Drop the gun.<br/> - You don't understand! - This guy was gonna kill someone! - I guess that makes two of us.<br/> Aah! What are you doing, Morty? This is a galactic federation outpost! Look, I don't have time to tell you my entire backstory, but grandpa and government don't get along.<br/> He saved my life.<br/> - What? - Huh?! Whoa! Are you Krombopulos Michael's target? W-what's your name? My kind has no use for names.<br/> I communicate through what you call ""Jessica's feet"" no, ""telepathy"".<br/> Oh, good job, Morty.<br/> Y-you killed my best customer, but you saved a mind-reading fart.<br/> I like this name fart.<br/> Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain.<br/> Morty, don't do it.<br/> Morty Morty, you idiot.<br/> Oh, crap.<br/> Let's get you out of here! We can't get him out of here.<br/> He's gaseous.<br/> He's not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.<br/> Well, then, I guess we're all getting in the car.<br/> - Right, uh - Fart.<br/> - No! Just just get in the car! - Morty, come on.<br/> I want to go back to Blips and Chitz.<br/> I don't want to deal with this.<br/> Rick, you've been clear on the fact that you don't want to help, so just go away.<br/> More are coming.<br/> Screw this.<br/> I'm out.<br/> Whoa! Come on, come on! Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire! Um, um, um, um! Open fire! Aah! Stupid-ass, fart-saving, carpet-store mother[bleep.]<br/>.<br/> Move! Wait, did you [bleep.]<br/> with my seat settings? More are coming.<br/> Rick! Yeah, yeah.<br/> Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.<br/> That's because my grandson drives like a male Obravadian.<br/> Yeah, I said it some stereotypes are based in fact.<br/> Actually, it's because of years of neglect.<br/> You really need to respect your gears, Rick.<br/> To you, they're just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought-- So I've heard.<br/> Just fix it.<br/> I don't think the gromflamites can track us now, but it looks like we're gonna be here for a while.<br/> Or, you know, if you still have that gun K.<br/> Michael dropped, we could finish the job and go home.<br/> - You do understand I'm telepathic, right? - I'm being polite.<br/> Rick, we're taking him back where he belongs.<br/> Oh, yeah? Where's that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it? I came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call ""Get out of my head, fart.<br/> I know you're in here.<br/> La-la-la-la"".<br/> No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula.<br/> Oh, great.<br/> Just a hop, skip, and an 800-light-year jump.<br/> You know, you can leave anytime you want, Rick.<br/> Whatever you want to do, you little punk-ass little bitch.<br/> Thank you, Morty.<br/> You are not like other carbon-based life-forms.<br/> You put the value of all life above your own.<br/> It's how things should be.<br/> It's how they could be.<br/> I could not agree more.<br/>  The worlds can be one together   Cosmos without hatred   Stars like diamonds in your eyes   The ground can be space   Space, space, space, space   With feet marching towards a peaceful sky   All the moon men want things their way   But we make sure they see the sun   Goodbye, moon men   You say goodbye, moon men   Goodbye  Shut the [bleep.]<br/> up about moon men! This isn't a musical number.<br/> This is a [bleep.]<br/> operation.<br/> We got to be cool and [bleep.]<br/> lay low.<br/> Duck, duck, birdie? That's very funny! Here comes another funny.<br/> Oh, this place is great.<br/> I almost wish I could stay longer than one day.<br/> You just might.<br/> W-what do you mean? These are the Jerrys whose Ricks and Mortys never came back.<br/> They live here now.<br/> Uh.<br/> No gear-turnings as of yet in the curious case of these unidentified humanoid fugitives, reportedly at large somewhere within the gear system.<br/> Son of a Why were the gromflamites holding you prisoner? What the [bleep.]<br/> is so valuable about you? I am no more valuable than life itself.<br/> However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this.<br/> That was oxygen.<br/> I added 71 protons to it.<br/> Terrific.<br/> The fart that pooped gold.<br/> No wonder every cop in the system is looking for us.<br/> Any species that gets ahold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy.<br/> You know how inconvenient that's gonna be to my work? Somebody dropped the dime on us.<br/> Gearhead! I'm sorry, Rick.<br/> The reward on your head is too high.<br/> And like you always say, you got to look out for number one.<br/> Number one is me, asshole! You're supposed to be my friend! Friend?! Do you even know my real name? It's Revolio Clockberg Junior.<br/> I belong to an entire species of gear people.<br/> Calling me ""gearhead"" is like calling a Chinese person ""Asia face"".<br/> No! Not twigs! Two things I want to make clear to everybody in this room never betray me, and it's time to go.<br/> Nobody move! Oh, my god.<br/> Are those  Hey, Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people that are getting killed today because of your choices? I did the right thing, Rick! - Tell that to gearhead's gearsticles.<br/> - You did that! Wrong! I'd be playing ""Roy"" right now.<br/> At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.<br/> I can't believe Rick did this.<br/> - This is the eighth to the last straw.<br/> - Ante up.<br/> You know what? Screw it! I have a better gamble for you guys.<br/> I say we escape.<br/> If you want to leave, you can just go out the front door.<br/> You think we're kept here against our will? That would be illegal.<br/> But if you can leave, then why are you still here? Same reason as you.<br/> We're Jerrys.<br/> I'm leaving.<br/> Okay, then.<br/> That was always allowed.<br/>  Morty, take the wheel! Whoa! Whoa! Geez! Damn it, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing? I'm kidding.<br/> I know that's on me.<br/> Um, Rick! Shit.<br/> Well, I guess this is it.<br/> Morty, crack the window.<br/> I wonder why Greg is always so critical of my girlfriend.<br/> Well, he'd probably like to have me to himself.<br/> That's how friends are.<br/> Or does he want herto himself?  The worlds can be one together   Cosmos without hatred   Stars like diamonds in your eyes  My life is a [bleep.]<br/> joke!  Goodbye, moon men   You say goodbye, moon men   Goodbye, moon men  All right.<br/> Let's proceed.<br/> Damn.<br/> Can't blame that on the dog.<br/> Talk about silent but deadly.<br/> I-I've seen some nerve gas, but that this gas got nerve! You know what I'm saying? - Are you done? - I'll let you know, Morty.<br/> Gone with the wind! Am I right?! If you don't like that one, Morty, an alt on that could be, like, if I said ""gasablanca""! All right, I'm done.<br/> Let's get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish saving a life! - Glagga blag blag.<br/> - Um, Earth, please? Is this Do I pay? Agga blag blag blag! Oh, I'm sorry, sorry! Ohh.<br/> Hmm.<br/> Mm, hey.<br/> Aah! Agga blag blag? Oh, uh, hey.<br/> What? - Agga blag! - Uh, what do you want? Agga blag blag ohh! Uh Hey.<br/> Are you the one that left? I get it.<br/> It's a it's a hassle out there.<br/> Right? And who needs that? - Right? - Right? - Not me.<br/> - Who needs that? Ho, ho! Not us.<br/> Uh, who are you? Oh, excuse me.<br/> Paul Fleischman.<br/> Infinite timelines.<br/> In some of them, Beth remarries.<br/> - Geez.<br/> - Don't worry.<br/> I treat Beth very well, and I do not overstep my bounds with Morty.<br/> Every kid needs a dad, but there's no replacing you.<br/> Hey, you want to give us a hand with this? We're trying to figure out how to get the sound coming through the stereo instead of the TV.<br/> It's very difficult.<br/> Oh! Uh, well, is there an aux input? We tried that, but there's two different colors.<br/> But there's two different colors.<br/> The wormhole is 70 of what you call ""meters"" what you call ""north"" of what you call ""here"".<br/> Fine.<br/> Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes.<br/> I'm gonna find some fuel and take a big, fat Morty.<br/> That's my new word for shit because of today's events.<br/>  Here it is.<br/> This should take me back to my kind.<br/> I'm gonna miss you, um, Fart.<br/> I'm really sorry your name became fart.<br/> - I will be back soon, Morty.<br/> - Really? After I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing.<br/> Um, cleansing? Carbon-based life is a threat to all higher life.<br/> To us, you are what you would call a disease.<br/> Wherever we discover you, we cure it.<br/> You said yourself that life must be protected, even though sacrifice.<br/> You haven't changed your mind about that.<br/> I can sense your thoughts.<br/> Morty? Um, before you go, could you sing a c-could you sing for me again? Yes, Morty.<br/>  Cosmos without hatred   Diamond stars of cosmic light   Quasars shine through endless night   And everything is one in the beauty   And now we say goodbye  Aah! Morty, why? Why? Goodbye.<br/> So, did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard? Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.<br/> Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad that you insisted on getting that fart home.<br/> You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn't for nothing, you know? You miss your fart friend, huh? Well, I got a little surprise for you, buddy.<br/> While you were gone, I found a new wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side, and they're all coming to visit.<br/> What?! Rick, no! You can't! Too late, Morty.<br/> The hole's opening.<br/> No, Rick! You don't understand.<br/> There's there's a lot more where that came from, too.<br/> Hey, hey, bro, how many people was your Morty responsible for killing today? None.<br/> We chilled at Blips and Chitz all day.<br/> Ain't that right, homey? Darn right, bro! ""Roy"" rules! Must be nice.<br/> Hey, Morty, there's our Jerry.<br/> Mm! I missed you.<br/> Hey, Rick.<br/> Glad you're safe, Jerry.<br/> - What do you say we go home? - I'd like that.<br/> Hey, wait.<br/> Uh, do you have 5126? Uh, I'm not sure.<br/> Morty.<br/> Uh, that's a Blips and Chitz ticket.<br/> - What?! - Way to go, Morty.<br/> Eh, whatever.<br/> - Uh, w-wait.<br/> What? - Uh, w-wait.<br/> What? All right.<br/> Come on, Jerry.<br/>  Are you tired of the same daily droll? Well, get on over to Blips and Chitz! We got, uh, one game.<br/> We got a whole bunch of games here.<br/> You can we got chabos and flobos, and you can shoot things! Get over here! Play the games! Uh, use your flerbos to get tickets! ""Roy 2"" just got here.<br/> Get over here at Jitz and Chitz! It's the coolest place in the world.<br/> Uh, I get to be in the commercial!   <br/>

Love   Connection   Experience  Yeah, Morty.<br/>  Come together   With love, connection, and experience  - It's my favorite song.<br/> - Oh, yeah.<br/> Oh, yeah, distress beacon! Yeah, baby! You're excited about that? The first rule of space travel, kids, is always check out distress beacons.<br/> it's a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit! Whoa! it's a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice.<br/>   Seems like something terrible happened here.<br/> Yep.<br/> Cha-ching.<br/> Oh, yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it.<br/> Give one of them a shake.<br/> Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship.<br/> Uh, what's that? This'll make the cops write it up as a looting by the korblocks.<br/> - That's horrible.<br/> - I hear you, man.<br/> Cops are racist.<br/> Oh, hey.<br/> You're alive.<br/> Thank god.<br/> Can you help us? Our planet was taken over by some kind of entity.<br/> It absorbed the minds of our people.<br/> We didn't notice until it was too late.<br/> The people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not themselves anymore.<br/> They're part of it.<br/> Then how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two dingdongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.<br/> Hey, no! No, wait! Stop! Called it.<br/> Hello, Rick.<br/> Long time no see.<br/> Unity? - Rick? - Grandpa? Oh, boy.<br/> Uh These are my grandkids, Summer and Morty.<br/> Summer, Morty, this is, uh, Unity.<br/> We sort of used to, uh date.<br/>   Quite an operation you got going here, Une.<br/> You're a whole planet now, huh? After we broke up, I spent some time wandering through space.<br/> - Then I found this world - Where I was better able to focus on my passion for unification.<br/> - You mean stealing people's bodies? - Summer, rude.<br/> Why don't you two kids go run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up.<br/> - Ugh.<br/> - No, wait, Rick, aren't these people gonna barf into our mouths and absorb us? You're guests here on my planet.<br/> You're free to be yourselves.<br/> I've never been any good at disappointing Rick.<br/> Well, now I'm going to barf.<br/> Come on, Morty.<br/> Jerry, what are you what are you doing in here? I'm trying to find our weed whacker, 'cause our weeds are wack, yo.<br/> But you can't go in the garage when Rick's not here.<br/> - I ""can't""? - Well, he doesn't like it.<br/> What's he gonna do? Crash rent-free at his other family's house? What is that supposed to mean? Your dad gets to walk all over us because of your abandonment issues.<br/> He's playing you, shorty.<br/> Oh, stop affecting that stupid hip-hop dialect.<br/> Stop shifting the cross hairs to my ironic urban patois just because your relationship with your father is to' up from the flo' up.<br/> What the hell was that? I don't know.<br/> Let's just leave.<br/> That is a hatch.<br/> Your father put a hatch in my garage.<br/> You don't know it was him.<br/> Anyway, we're not supposed to be in here.<br/> Obviously, neither is whatever's gurgling down there.<br/> ""World peace achieved.<br/>"" Nice.<br/> Little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey.<br/> So, what's next? After I become a type-one civilization, this world will be invited into the galactic federation.<br/> Oh, goody.<br/> From there, I'll have access to countless planets and species.<br/> One by one, I will unify them, I will become the universe, and I will be what the single-minded once called the God.<br/> I like that.<br/> Oh, that's pretty sexy.<br/> Hey, listen, where can we get a drink around here? Recreational substances were phased out here.<br/> There's no need for escape from the self when your world is one.<br/> Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker.<br/> Rick, when we met, I was a young hive mind with the population of a small town.<br/> People change Especially when I change them.<br/> I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I've grown.<br/> Hey, listen, I've grown, too.<br/> I have! See, I've I've reconnected with my family, right? Hm.<br/> Why's that, I wonder? Maybe it's part of getting old.<br/> Maybe I just missed being with a collective.<br/> Yes, Rick.<br/> Yes.<br/> Oh, yeah.<br/> Yes.<br/> Yes.<br/> Wait, wait.<br/> Stop.<br/> Hold it.<br/> Not like this.<br/> We need a hang glider and a crotchless uncle Sam costume, and I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads, and I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father.<br/> Man, look at them go.<br/> So coordinated.<br/> What's your problem? They're making you into a Mount Rushmore.<br/> They made burgers! Morty, open your eyes.<br/> There is no ""they"".<br/> These poor people's bodies are being used.<br/> They're a planet of puppets.<br/> - I can hear you.<br/> - Ugh.<br/> Well, it seems like everybody here's cool with it.<br/> Except for all those redheads.<br/> They seem like they're in a hurry to be somewhere else.<br/> Balloon, Summer? Balloon, Morty? No, we don't want your dumb balloons, okay? We're bored.<br/> Take us back to Rick.<br/> Now's not a good time.<br/> Oh, yeah! I want yooooooou! Go, son, go! Go, son, go! Go, son, go! Oh, real nice.<br/> Real nice.<br/> How does a man do this without me noticing? Oh, you know my dad once he puts his mind to something.<br/> You're spinning this to his credit? I'm going down there.<br/> - Jerry-- - Beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair, and my faceless gargler.<br/> Now, are you gonna keep hating this playa or are you gonna jack my steez? Okay, you're just making stuff up now.<br/> Ugh.<br/> Oh, my god.<br/> Oh, my god.<br/> Ugh! Oh, Rick.<br/> That was so bad.<br/> What's this ""was"" stuff? I just need to hydrate, then we're doing that again.<br/> - Oh, damn.<br/> - Listen, if this is an invasion, I got to sit this one out, but I'll be back to have sex with the survivors.<br/> It's a neighboring hive-mind species, beta seven.<br/> Our planets maintain a practical alliance for exchange of vital resources, so be nice.<br/> Unity, is it a bad time? Are all present life forms assimilated? Beta seven, this is my single-minded friend from Earth, Rick.<br/> Rick Sanchez.<br/> Unity has spoken of you.<br/> All bad, I hope.<br/> Ha ha! Bleeeeeeeeeh! Oh, Jesus Christ.<br/> Beta seven, if my allies are a problem for you, perhaps our alliance is, as well.<br/> Our alliance is beneficial.<br/> When beta seven expresses concern, it's only because-- Oh, snap! Powdered neutronium? Amphetetron? You know I can make with this stuff? Oh, Rick, I-- I shouldn't.<br/> Come on.<br/> It's not every day that I'm town.<br/> It's for old time's sake.<br/> Uh Okay, what the hell.<br/> We can purify the resin and make fractal dust.<br/> Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but-- Aw, old man Rick can't party with a whole planet? I can do whatever you do and more, baby.<br/> You know, I think beta seven over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical.<br/> Stop.<br/> Well, this explains the $6,000 electric bill.<br/> Whoa! Well, nice.<br/> Real nice.<br/> Alien prisoners under the house.<br/> Real nice.<br/> Nice.<br/> Reeeeeeeeeeeeeal-- God damn it, stop.<br/> Wake up, people! You have to fight it! You're under the spell of an evil monster! - I can hear you.<br/> - Yeah, so you keep saying.<br/> - Summer! - Wake up! You have to have some individuality left in there! Why do you hate me, Summer? I'm not talking you.<br/> I'm talking to Steven Phillips.<br/> Steven, set yourself free.<br/> Summer, before I took over this planet, this man was a registered sex offender.<br/> Yeah? Well, so what? At least he was himself.<br/> This woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide.<br/> Now she's a marine biologist.<br/> Listen, Unity, I don't think my sister's trying to say that life would be perfect without you.<br/> I think she's just saying that life would be, you know, life.<br/> I have transformed life here into a paradise.<br/> Prostitutes are now scientists.<br/> The homeless are now ""phisosophers"".<br/> Oh.<br/> Oh.<br/> ""Ph-phisosophers""? Nice.<br/> - Philopol phiphophopher - Oh, my god.<br/> Where did you learn to talk, you grandpa-stealing slut? I'm feeling Ugh.<br/> Oh, man, let me help all of you guys up.<br/> I'm fine.<br/> Do you know what I love about you, Rick? You're the only single mind I've met that really sees the big picture.<br/> You got that right.<br/> But, baby, listen y-you're talking about taking over planets and galaxies.<br/> You got to just remember to let go sometimes, you know? I can let go.<br/> Hey, look.<br/> You see that town across the river? Watch this.<br/> - Whoa! - Ha ha! Whoo! Whoa! That's not what I meant! It's okay.<br/> It's okay.<br/> I evacuated.<br/> I evacuated the town.<br/> Look.<br/> Hey! We're right here.<br/> We're fine.<br/> Oh, that was awesome.<br/> My my grandkids weren't in that town, right? A-are my grandkids alive? M-my drink is empty.<br/>   - Unity, what's happening? - Who's Unity? You kids have nice feet.<br/> Mind if I take a picture? Gross.<br/> No.<br/> I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer.<br/> Something's happening to Unity.<br/> Do all of you remember who you are? Yeah, uh, my name is Ron Benson.<br/> I'm an electrical engineer, father of two, and, as you can see from my flat, concentric nipple rings, I'm a member of this planet's top race! Okay, that's good.<br/> Uh, don't focus too much on the last part, but-- I'm Daryl Jefferson.<br/> I'm a landscaper.<br/> And I'll be damned if that ripple-nipple bitch's race is superior! The cone-nipple people will rule this world! You shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastards.<br/> What'd you say to me, you target-chest piece of [bleep.]<br/>? Race war! Ugh! Why are you fighting?! Can't you see you're all the same? Oh, Summer.<br/> First race war, huh? Way to go, Summer.<br/> You started a race war.<br/> I didn't start it! They're the racists.<br/> I merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams.<br/> Okay, thanks for clarifying.<br/> I'll have a super-accurate headstone now.<br/> Hey, wait what race are you guys? We're neither.<br/> S-see? Yeah, take my word for it.<br/> We just have regular nipples.<br/> Hey, these two freaks have no race!   Oh, there's no place like home.<br/> There's no place like home.<br/> Remember, Summer? - From Dorothy and the tiny people movie? - Yes, yes.<br/> - All the tiny people.<br/> - Dorothy, take us away.<br/>   Hello, Summer.<br/> Hello, Morty.<br/> - It's okay.<br/> You're safe now.<br/> - Unity? - Yes.<br/> - Oh, Unity, I am so sorry.<br/> I didn't know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks.<br/> I was thinking more of a choose your own cellphone-carrier thing.<br/> Oh, Summer, you did nothing wrong.<br/> I'm having fun with your grandpa.<br/> Lost a little control.<br/> Probably shouldn't be piloting a hovercopter, nor should I be running and 12 million deep fryers, but hey, it's not like this planet can take its business elsewhere.<br/> Um, should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? Maybe splash a little water on your face, or No, no, if I wanted to be sober, I wouldn't have gotten drunk.<br/> Whoo-hoo-hoo! Oh, man.<br/> I cannot wait-- I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this.<br/> He is gone.<br/> Jerry, stop, please, okay? We weren't even supposed to be down here.<br/> If we confront him about this-- Oh, my god! I love this.<br/> I love that this is how far you will go for him.<br/> You want to go upstairs and cut carrots and watch a Lifetime original above a [bleep.]<br/> alien dungeon! Your relationship with your father is psychotic.<br/> Oh, listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person.<br/> Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing; it's a monster.<br/> He might have it chained up so that it doesn't eat the planet! Right, because your father's such an altruist? I once saw him briefly forget the word for ""humans"".<br/> He's probably harvesting this creature's organs.<br/> He's probably racing to cure its space AIDS.<br/> - He's going to eat it! - He's protecting it! - Shut up! - Shut up! Whoa! Unity, this place is a mess.<br/> Oh, it's cool.<br/> The part of me that's the cleaning lady is coming on Friday.<br/> Oh, my god.<br/> I have a meeting at the Galactic Federation in an hour.<br/> Oh, I'll never make it.<br/> Ah, I'll push it to next week.<br/> Unity, could you get Rick out here, please? He's unavailable.<br/> He's Having sex with you.<br/> We get it.<br/> Gross.<br/> Get him out here now.<br/> I don't think he wants to be-- - Grandpa Rick! - Rick! Rick! I'm gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage! What the hell is your problem? Grandpa, we need to go home, now.<br/> Fine.<br/> Sheesh.<br/> See you.<br/> Uh, Rick, I think we should allgo.<br/> Tend to your garden, kids.<br/> I'm kind of doing a thing here.<br/> Whoo! Grandpa Rick, we're not leaving without you.<br/> Oh, my god, you guys.<br/> I get it.<br/> You're afraid the big, bad hive mind is gonna steal your grandpa away.<br/> Actually, no.<br/> I think Unity's great and you're a horrible influence on it.<br/> - What? - This isn't healthy, Rick.<br/> You know, you're really up to no good around here a-at this place, you know? You and Unity are like like leggings and mid-calf boots.<br/> You think you're great together, but you're just bringing out the worst in each other.<br/> Oh, gee.<br/> Boy, Summer.<br/> Well put.<br/> Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks? Unity? I'm just taking a little break from stuff.<br/> You know? I need to relax.<br/> Oh, hey, w-what's this on the news, guys? Let me turn it up.<br/> In the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is.<br/> We're really just having a good time.<br/> - Karen? - Thanks, Todd.<br/> Up next, are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill? We'll tell you how you can know for sure.<br/> I think you two are a little outnumbered.<br/> Okay, well, what if you did it for me? What if you came with us as a favor to us because you love us? What? Dumb.<br/> Bye.<br/> But Rick, Summer's just--- Summer's just a hyper-emotional, needy little-- What's the word I'm looking for here? Uh Human.<br/> It runs in the family.<br/> I can tolerate it, but I can't give a crap about it.<br/> Take a hike.<br/> Take care of yourself, Unity.<br/> I'm not looking for judgment, just a yes or no can you assimilate a giraffe? - You're the worst! - No, you're the worst! You don't support this family! All you care about is yourself! - Is about supporting you emotionally - You've got two children - but you're unsupportable.<br/> - Being dragged across the cosmos - because it's never enough, Jerry! - By your dangerously ill father! And you force me to watch it happen because you'd rather lose them and lose me And you don't even know what it's like to be afraid of losing anything Than lose him! - Because you cling and you cling - Because you're the child, Beth! You, not me! You! - Aah! - Aah! - Oh, my god.<br/> - Aah! Um, first of all, hello.<br/> Uh, my name is Blim Blam the Korblok.<br/> Second of all, cards on the table, I'm a murderer that eats babies, and I came to this planet to eat babies.<br/> However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease that I suppose you could call ""space AIDS"" as you put it.<br/> And Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it.<br/> At the same time, Rick's motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else's, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarcks.<br/> But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall? And do you know why I'm never coming back to this planet? Because the two of you are the [bleep.]<br/> worst! You both hate yourselves and each other.<br/> And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable.<br/> I'd laugh, but I'm biologically incapable.<br/> That's how alien I am.<br/> And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you and being like, ""What the [beep.]<br/>""? So good luck with your shitty marriage, and tell Rick I'm sorry he has to deal with either of you.<br/> Blim Blam out.<br/> You know what? I'm taking this.<br/> How do you-- What is this? Uh, is there a slow setting? Best door ever.<br/> Okay, okay.<br/> Now make them cry, but happy crying.<br/> Now make them all make fun of the blonde one.<br/> Now make them all do it on the table.<br/> I can't believe you created a whole show for me.<br/> Now cancel it.<br/> Okay, now put it back on.<br/> All right, I'm bored.<br/> Rick, is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty? - I feel bad that they-- - Pbht.<br/> Screw those guys.<br/> Ugh.<br/> I'll be right back.<br/> Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity.<br/> They're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy.<br/> They just put you at the center of their lives because you're powerful.<br/> And then because they put you there, they want you to be less powerful.<br/> Never gonna happen though, right? Never.<br/> Never.<br/> Back in a flash.<br/> Best weekend ever, Rick.<br/> I agree, Rick.<br/> Let's see how long we can go.<br/> Hey, Une.<br/> You got any more-- Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes.<br/> I'm not strong enough to do it in persons.<br/> I realize now that I'm attracted to you for the same reason I can't be with you.<br/> You can't change.<br/> And I have no problem with that, but it clearly means I have a problem with myself.<br/> I'm sure there's no perfect version of me.<br/> I'm sure I'll just unify species after species and never really be complete.<br/> But I know how it goes with us.<br/> I lose who I am and become part of you.<br/> Because in a strange way, you're better at what I do without even trying.<br/> Yours, and nobody else's, Unity.<br/> P.<br/>S.<br/>, I don't know where those coal miners were before they were assimilated.<br/> You might want to get checked.<br/> Hey.<br/> Dad.<br/> I, um Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker and found your subterranean lair and your alien prisoner, and he got away.<br/> And I know I sound like mom, but I can't sacrifice this whole family's safety just because I'm afraid you'll leave again, so no more alien prisoners and no more subterranean excavation without consulting us.<br/> - Okay.<br/> - Okay? ""Okay"" like you're gonna quietly teleport somewhere - and never come back? - No.<br/> It's your house.<br/> Grandpa Rick, what happened with Unity? Who? Oh, Unity.<br/> Yeah, well I mean, honestly, we're talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know? It's not cool.<br/> Fun's fun, but who needs it? I'll be in the garage.<br/>  Lay it, lay it down   Let me see your hand   Show me what you got   You're always talking   But you're not playing   It doesn't match your face   Get them away, away from this place   Can you take me now?   I, I want it   I want it real   Are you afraid of me now?    Are you afraid of me now?   Do you feel it?   Do you feel it?   Do you feel that I can see your soul?   Do you feel it?   Do you feel it?   Do you feel the pain in your heart?   I, I want it   I want it real   Run away with me now   I, I want it   I want it real   Run away with me now   Ah, ah     Don't leave me   Never leave me out   Don't leave me   Never leave me out  Unity! Unity! Unity! How can I assist you? I want to talk to Unity, beta seven.<br/> I know it's in there.<br/> You're classified as a hostile entity, and Unity doesn't want to talk to you.<br/> I know your game, beta seven.<br/> I've met a billion of you, you little on-deck, in-the-wings shoulder to cry on! You are classified as a hostile entity.<br/> Oh, you're just loving this, mother-- This isn't gonna shake out like you think, pal.<br/> Unity's not into other hive minds.<br/> It's gonna suck you in and use you up, and a month from now, I'm gonna be making out with all of you in a bunch of red wigs! Unity! Unity! Unity, I know you can hear me.<br/> Get out here.<br/> Weapons systems engaged.<br/> Oh, in your dreams you have weapon systems.<br/> Ugh, Rick, you said we were going to a movie.<br/> We are, Morty.<br/> All right, beta shit seven, you just got saved by the bell, bitch! Did you get any of that? It's-a good show-a.<br/> <br/>

<|endoftext|>

Steve, I just got a weird e-mail.<br/> Did you buy us airline tickets? Aw, shoot.<br/> It was supposed to be a surprise.<br/> I wanted to thank you for letting me live here all this time, so I'm treating the family to a vacation! Steve, you're so sweet.<br/> - Thanks, uncle Steve! - Best uncle ever! Look out, world.<br/> The Smith family is going to Paris! Yeah! Awesome! Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash! Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry, but life is made of little concessions.<br/> I-- You know what? You're gonna land on your feet, Jer.<br/> Some company out there's gonna thank their lucky stars they hired my little brother.<br/> - Who the [bleep.]<br/> are you? - My goofy brother, Steve.<br/> He's been living here almost a year now.<br/> Are you losing your mind? Hey, someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks.<br/> Am I right? - Oh, my god! - Call an ambulance! - Oh, god! Steve! - What the hell, Rick?! Will everybody just relax for a second? There's no such thing as an ""uncle Steve"".<br/> That is an alien parasite.<br/> - But I've known him my whole life.<br/> - No, you haven't, Jerry.<br/> These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories, and then they use those to multiply and spread out, take over planets.<br/> It's-- It's disgusting.<br/> - Steve wasn't real? - He's a real piece of shit.<br/> This is a big one.<br/> Somebody probably tracked it in last week on the bottom of their shoe on a piece of alien fruit.<br/> - Someone? - Get off the high road, Summer.<br/> We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet.<br/> But uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike! No, ""Steve"" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply.<br/> We could be infested with these things.<br/> So we got to keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up.<br/> Ooh, whee! Whatever you want, Rick! We're here to help! Thanks, Mr.<br/> Poopybutthole.<br/> I always could count on you.<br/>   All right.<br/> There's six of us, and that's it.<br/> Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr.<br/> Poopybutthole, and Summer.<br/> Maybe you got the first one in time, Rick! Can't afford to chance it.<br/> Dad, why does our house have blast shields? Trust me, Beth, you don't want to know how many answers that question has.<br/> Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic! Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together.<br/> Y-- remember that? After ""The Hulk"" musical? Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don't make you strong.<br/> I know.<br/> Friends make you strong.<br/> I watched the same musical you did.<br/> Why couldn't I bring my portal gun? Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the hulk.<br/> I just got that.<br/> Just pee your pants.<br/> I did it the minute we got stuck.<br/> Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me.<br/> At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose.<br/> Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine.<br/> I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be.<br/> Somebody call for repairs? Yay! Cousin Nicky! It's me, cousin Nicky.<br/> I'm walkin' here! I mean, I'm not.<br/> I'm crouched in the elevator shaft, but hey, I'm walkin' here! It's true.<br/> We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we're cooped up like this.<br/> Hey, maybe Mr.<br/> Poopypants is right.<br/> Let's get some fresh air.<br/> Come on, cousin Nicky.<br/> You heard Rick.<br/> We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things.<br/> I hear you, Morty.<br/> Back in Brooklyn, we got a sayin'-- ""We're walkin' here!"" Nicky, get-- Oh! What the? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?! Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real.<br/> But how did you know it was Nicky? I guessed.<br/> That's why I aimed for his shoulder.<br/> So we can't trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old Nazi submarine.<br/> Did that not even happen? Well, of course it happened.<br/> Now that I possess the mighty staff of rah-gubaba, the world will tremble before the Fourth Reich! This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick.<br/> Hey, we got a word for Nazis back in Brooklyn, pal.<br/> I'm comfortable being called a Nazi.<br/> You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings? Yeah.<br/> Think before you talk shit.<br/> Rah-gubaba, help me kill America! Mr.<br/> Beauregard! After due consideration, I have elected not to retire.<br/> Yeah! Oh, thank god! Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend.<br/> Set a course for Morty's high school.<br/> Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn't still be the family butler.<br/> Dare to dream.<br/> Wait.<br/> And if Mr.<br/> Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble.<br/> No! Don't flashback! You're just gonna make more swelling.<br/> - Just relax.<br/> - Don't worry, Jerry.<br/> We called the fire department.<br/> You know they won't come here anymore.<br/> Marmalade is served! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, whee! I guess I take back what I said about British cuisine.<br/> Take that, Summer! We're trying to sleep.<br/> I don't want to go to the dance alone.<br/> Then perhaps you shouldn't.<br/> Aww.<br/> Mr.<br/> Beauregard.<br/> - Shall we, master Morty? - We shall.<br/> Oh, wait, don't leave without letting photography Raptor take a picture.<br/> Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress.<br/> Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house.<br/> But there's always been 10.<br/> No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites.<br/> You sure about that, Rick? Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number.<br/> All right, there's six of us.<br/> And that's it.<br/> Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr.<br/> Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, photography Raptor, Mr.<br/> Beauregard, and Summer.<br/> Uh, dad, that's like 10 people.<br/> I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at? - Here, Rick! Use me! - Oh, thanks, Pencilvester! Yeah, I guess that is what happened, but I don't get why I would do that.<br/> Everybody makes mistakes, Rick.<br/> Why do you think I have one of these? That's it.<br/> Photos.<br/> Hard evidence.<br/> You're not in any of my photos, Mr.<br/> Poopybutthole.<br/> Well, what do you know about this? You're not in any of mine.<br/> All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school.<br/> What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It's not like we're mormon or dying.<br/> I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen.<br/> Summer! Tinkles! It's past my bedtime.<br/> Not in never past bedtime land! Here we go!  Summer and Tinkles friends with each other   Living in never past bedtime land   No kitchen sinkles no little brother   Going to raves and waving our hands   Summer and tinkle, friends to the end   Group text the whole crew, my mother friends!   Ketchup to the salt, salt to the fry   ""T"" to the ""inkle"" with a capital ""I""  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! - Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! - Summer, we're trying to sleep.<br/> It was Tinkles! Tinkles? That is su-- Suspicious.<br/> We're always hearing about this Tinkles character, - but we never get to-- - Hi, everybody.<br/> I'm Tinkles, and these are my friends.<br/> See, everyone? Tinkles is real.<br/> That means so am I.<br/> - Sorry, Summer.<br/> - Man, I'm sorry, Summer.<br/> I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one.<br/> Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't.<br/> I know who the Smiths are.<br/> I've known Beth since high school.<br/> And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend.<br/> Thanks, Jerry.<br/> Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off.<br/> Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long.<br/> I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl.<br/> Aah! - Grandpa Rick! - Hold still, ""Summer"".<br/> Rick, that is my daughter.<br/> Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years.<br/> Don't make me hurt you.<br/> Rick, these are our family and friends, the people we barbecue with.<br/> Have you forgotten the barbecue? Wait, why would you want me to-- You're one of them, aren't you? Rick.<br/> You love those barbecues, Rick.<br/> You love them.<br/> Hai! Remember it, Rick? Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan? Remember the barbecue.<br/> Remember the barbecue.<br/> Remember the barbecue.<br/> You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing.<br/> - You're good at it, Rick.<br/> - Watch me, baby.<br/> I'm like Tom Cruise from, um, ""Cuisine"" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks.<br/> Yeah, check me out.<br/> I'm like Tom Cruise from ""Cuisine"".<br/> Yeah.<br/> Is that what it's called? ""Cuisine""? Wow! Hey, everybody.<br/> Let's give it up for the grillmaster Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Wait.<br/> Noooooo! Shoot.<br/> Now look.<br/> It's like a ""Where's Waldo?"" page.<br/> Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters.<br/> We'll be right back after these messages.<br/> I think you should put down the gun and we should get you to a doctor.<br/> What do you say we take down these blast shields? - Yeah.<br/> - I can't do that, Sleepy Gary.<br/> All right, everybody listen to me.<br/> I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out.<br/> But, Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff.<br/> You guys, we got to hurry.<br/> I just got back from Walmart.<br/> They're selling Nintendo 3DS systems for $149.<br/>99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card.<br/> Brings the total price down to $110 after tax.<br/> Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition ""Zelda"" ones.<br/> Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play Nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff.<br/> Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that.<br/> Don't overreact, Rick.<br/> - Sleepy Gary, a word? - Sure, Jerry.<br/> Rick, keep a level head, okay? 'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein-- He's actually Frankenstein's monster.<br/> Sleepy Gary, my head is filled with memories of our friendship.<br/> I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then Jerry, just say it.<br/> Sleepy Gary, how do we know I'm real? Jesus, Jerry.<br/> No, you're real.<br/> Hey, look at me.<br/> Now, I don't know which way is up out there, but I know us, and you're real, Jerry.<br/> Remember our vacation? They're filming that new ""Star Wars"" movie down the coast.<br/> - Should we check it out? - Sure.<br/> Why not? Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.<br/> I'd like that.<br/> What are we doing? I don't give a damn what else happens out there.<br/> You and I are going to survive this.<br/> Okay.<br/> Hey, we agreed.<br/> Never in the house.<br/> That's a cool watch there, Rick.<br/> Can I check it out? Uh, no thank-- Okay.<br/> Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here? Ah, you're paranoid, Rick.<br/> You've been paranoid since 'nam.<br/> So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein? Shi-i-i-i-t.<br/> I'mma bust a-- No! Get out of my head, parasite! - No! - Drop it.<br/> Give me the gun, Frankenstein! Give it back! Yeah! Frankenstein! Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on Earth?! Maybe.<br/> Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real.<br/> You know me.<br/> I'm Reverse Giraffe.<br/> I have a short neck and legs.<br/> - I went to college with Hamurai.<br/> - Hai! I saved Ghost in a Jar's life in Vietnam.<br/> - Boo rah! - And, Beth, how many times have I been a shoulder for you to cry on? Too many.<br/> Okay, so maybe we're just all fake.<br/> That don't make no sense! Or maybe there's only one deceiver here-- The person that keeps telling us the path to salvation is being held prisoner and mistrusting each other.<br/> Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer I know we all have beloved memories of Rick, but are we really supposed to believe that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years? Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases.<br/> Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes.<br/> Hit the sack, Jack.<br/> Uh-oh! Somersault jump.<br/> AIDS! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah.<br/> No jumpin' in the sewer.<br/> Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls! Yeah! Say that all the time.<br/> That's a fake-ass catchphrase right there.<br/> Yeah, don't forget his incredibly vague back story.<br/> Beth, I'm your father! Oh, are you, dad? Are you? Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and-- And-- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here! Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name? Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! In your face! Give me the gun.<br/> I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester.<br/> Bring him to the garage.<br/> You listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum.<br/> We could either do this the easy way or the hard way.<br/> You know, y-y-y-- Do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors.<br/> Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too.<br/> You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us.<br/> You know, w-we all remember you as a friend.<br/> Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty! - Oh-- oh, yeah? - Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb, little ass and about six of them are pleasant.<br/> The rest is annoying garbage.<br/> So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, mother[bleep.]<br/>! Pull the [bleep.]<br/> trigger! Oh, wow.<br/> Baby wizard was a parasite? He set me up with my wife.<br/> What the hell? I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories.<br/> I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!  These memories that we have   These memories that we cherish   I wish that we can go back to that time   Ooh, ooh, ooh  Holy crap, Morty, you're right.<br/> Isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me? Well, yeah, duh-doy.<br/> Took you long enough.<br/> Now let's go, Morty.<br/> We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate.<br/> Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining.<br/> We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly.<br/> Who's got a bad memory about Mrs.<br/> Refrigerator? I-I-- everyone has bad memories of me.<br/> You remember that one time? Ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming.<br/> Uh, roller coasters aren't bad, Mrs.<br/> Refrigerator.<br/> They're thrilling.<br/> And you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life.<br/> The jig is up! Get me out of here.<br/> Get me out of here! Aah! Oh [bleep.]<br/>! Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear.<br/> So what about Summer? Why am I always your go-to? - Never go in my room again.<br/> - I didn't! She's real.<br/> She's my bitch of a sister.<br/> Nice.<br/>  Mom, are you driving me to-- Hmm? Yeah, yeah, yes.<br/> What time? Oh, my god.<br/> Are you drunk? What are you? - My wife coach? - Your what? Oh! God! Oh.<br/> Oh, my gosh.<br/> - Oh! God! Mom! - Sweetheart, are you okay? - I didn't mean to-- - I'm gonna have a bruise! - It's picture day! - It's not-- don't overreact.<br/> I can clean it up.<br/> I want the police to take me! Morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem.<br/> Thank you, sweetie.<br/> Beth, Beth, please! I thought it was too good to be true that we'd have compatible kidneys.<br/> Come on, man.<br/> Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester.<br/> Give me anything.<br/> Rick, I'm Pencilvester.<br/> Listen to that name.<br/> You can't kill me.<br/> You're right.<br/> Kill Pencilvester.<br/> Summer, I've always loved you! Yep.<br/> - Oh, my god! - I thought you went to a concert! We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?! I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me! You're not the victim here! I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace! Aaaaaah! Ah.<br/> Master Rick.<br/> Remember when you weren't going to shoot me? I guess I did the Butler! Ha ha! Does-- Does that scan? Oh, I get it.<br/> It's a play on ""The Butler did it.<br/>"" Thanks, Ghost in a Jar.<br/> You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy.<br/> You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary.<br/> Don't worry.<br/> I have a plan.<br/> If we can get to my boat, there's a-- No.<br/> No! Just send me to Gary.<br/> I want to be with Gary.<br/> Oh, god.<br/> Whoa.<br/> What the hell? Look out for that homeless guy! Open the door! Open the door! There isn't time! Just run! Get out here and help me! They say you shouldn't do that! Just run! Ugh.<br/> Sorry, Jerry.<br/> You're real.<br/> I'm a parasite! Yeah, but you're real.<br/> Uh, uh, I need time to forget about Sleepy Gary.<br/> Me, too.<br/> From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space.<br/> That goes for everyone.<br/> This is depressing.<br/> We killed every good person in the house.<br/> We're what's left? What a family.<br/> At least we're real, Jerry.<br/> We're real.<br/> Ricky ticky tavi! Ooh, whee! Amen to that.<br/> Now, this little Poopypants is hungry.<br/> Will somebody pass me a pork chop? Huh.<br/> Is-- is something wrong, Beth? Ow! Oh, my god! - No, Beth! - Oh [bleep.]<br/>! Wait, but I-- - Oh, Beth! Why?! - I need an ambulance! There's been a shooting.<br/> My wife shot Uh, my-- my wife shot a long-time family friend.<br/> Why? Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, Mr.<br/> Poopybutthole.<br/> - I-I thought-- - Keep breathing! - Oh, god.<br/> What's happening? - Look at me! Look at me! Don't-- don't fall asleep! Is-- is this what bleeding to death is? Oh, whee.<br/> Is this how I die? Oh, geez! Oh, my god! Why would you do this, Beth? It's not supposed to hurt.<br/> I-I thought Ooh, whee.<br/>  Oh, he-- he's looking a lot better.<br/> Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself.<br/> I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale.<br/> - Is, um, is he mad at me? - He's not pressing charges.<br/> I mean, that's got to be the ""you shot me"" equivalent of not being mad.<br/> - Can he have visitors? - He'd like to be alone.<br/> He told me to tell you he's sorry you didn't have bad memories of him? If you love him, you should leave.<br/> And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes.<br/> Did you get any of that? It's-a good show-a.<br/> <br/>

Hey, golf is easy now! Aah! Golf is hard again! Golf is hard again! The view from here is the same as yours, Jim.<br/> A giant head has entered earth's gravity, triggering climate change and natural disasters we thought were impossible for at least another eight years.<br/> Let's not make this political, Terry.<br/> Do we know what this giant head wants? Show me what you got.<br/> Jim, you heard the Said-- ""Show me what you got.<br/>"" Show me what you got.<br/> I want to see what you got.<br/> Oh, boy.<br/> Time to go, Morty.<br/> Uh, where? The Pentagon.<br/> I mean, not the Pentagon.<br/> The lame one here on earth.<br/>  Summer: Is it God? If it's God, do we get out of school? It's not God, Summer.<br/> She's allowed to think it's God if she wants, honey.<br/> - Shut up, Jerry.<br/> - Okay.<br/> Dad, what do you know about this? Morty and I are going to look into it.<br/> You guys hold tight.<br/> Scary stuff, huh? Pretty freaky.<br/> Hi.<br/> I'm Morty's math teacher.<br/> I'm also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together.<br/> How is praying going to help? Ma'am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather.<br/> Did you want to play checkers? Let's be rational! I'll see you at God's house! Gentlemen, gentlemen! One at a time! Simon? SETI, NORAD, and every broadcaster on the planet are attempting to show this being what humanity's got-- String theory, world history, the human genome-- Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr.<br/> President, what America's got is 70,000 megatons of kaboom-boom, and I say we show it right up this floating head's ass.<br/> No, you need to let me talk! Shut up! Hold it! Don't move! Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!  Oh! Stand down! Everybody, stand down! I'm the leader of these people, and I'm unarmed.<br/> There's no need for any more snake-makery.<br/> My name is Rick Sanchez.<br/> This here is my grandson, Morty.<br/> - Hi, Morty.<br/> - Hey.<br/> I've seen enough of the galaxy to know what we've got here is a cromulon from the signus five expanse.<br/> So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.<br/> This head won't go away until Earth shows them it's got A hit song.<br/> A hit song? We can't possibly-- - You mean like Vivaldi? - No, Frasier.<br/> A live performance of a newly written, catchy original song.<br/> The cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved life-forms.<br/> All right, all right.<br/> Thank you, Mr.<br/> Sanchez.<br/> Change of plan, people.<br/> Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream.<br/> The-Dream? He wrote ""Umbrella"" and ""Single Ladies""? You people haven't heard of The-Dream? You're gonna want to put them on that giant speaker system at your Sonic testing facility at Area 51.<br/> How do you know about that? For God's sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes.<br/> He can use Google Maps.<br/> Sir, Pharrell, Newman, Corgan, and that Dream guy-- - They're all dead.<br/> - What? How is that possible? Do people just die when I name them? The Grammys, sir.<br/> There was an earthquake and all the musicians, all the famous ones they're gone.<br/> Dear God.<br/> Hold on, sir.<br/> Just a minute.<br/> Ice-T survived.<br/> He's inbound on an F-15, E.<br/>T.<br/>A.<br/> two hours.<br/> Good luck, Mr.<br/> President.<br/> Sir, the magnetic poles are about to reverse.<br/> In two hours, there may not be an Earth to save.<br/> Sanchez? Are you a musician? I dabble, Mr.<br/> President.<br/> Get this man and his grandson on a black hawk to Area 51.<br/> People! Everyone! Remain calm! Every crisis of faith is an opportunity for more faith.<br/> When God deals you an 11, you don't fold! You double down! And always hit on a soft 16.<br/> That means you, Jews.<br/> I beg your pardon, pastor, but the last I looked outside, it seems to be you that's been dealt the weak hand.<br/> Jews rule! Nobody? Okay, tough church.<br/> Hi.<br/> Principal Vagina-- The name's real, possibly Scandinavian.<br/> I'm just gonna come out and make this pitch-- The old Gods are dead.<br/> [Bleep.]<br/> all previous existing religions.<br/> All hail the one true God-- The giant head in the sky.<br/> - Children of God! - Ah-ta-ta-ta! Bob, Bob, I get it.<br/> But unless this can beat that, what have you done for me lately? So, if you'll all excuse me, I'm going out onto the sidewalk, I'm dropping to my knees, and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the [bleep.]<br/> weather.<br/> Out of my way.<br/> Okay.<br/> If sanity's been restored to this assembly, I'd like to talk about the cost of repairing our new organ.<br/> Sally, the plate, please.<br/> Oh! This is my favorite part! - Rick, are you really a musician? - Who's not a musician, Morty? - Me! - Yeah, not with that attitude.<br/> We're in the drop zone! I'm the jumpmaster! My name's Jamey-- With an e-y! Go, go, go! B-but-- But we don't have a song! Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we've done.<br/> We're sorry for our increased levels of emissions and our racism and, of course, the Amber Alerts I keep ignoring on my phone.<br/> - Whoa! - Whoa! All right, Morty.<br/> Let's get-- let's do it.<br/> Why don't you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat? Rick, I think we need to cut our losses.<br/> W-we get our family and portal out of here! Morty, good music comes from people who are relaxed.<br/> Just hit a button, Morty! Give me a beat! Oh, man.<br/> Okay.<br/> All right, um  Oh, yeah   You gotta get schwifty   You gotta get schwifty in here   It's time to get schwifty   Uh-oh  Get ""schwifty""? What the hell is that? It's our world's best effort.<br/> That's what.<br/>  Take off your pants and your panties   Shit on the floor   Time to get schwifty in here   I'm Mr.<br/> Bulldops  ""Mr.<br/> Bulldops""? Don't analyze it, Nathan.<br/> It's working!  Take a shit on the floor   Time to get schwifty in here  and third-level donors get our all-access family pass.<br/> Listen! The storm is stopping!  Hey, take your pants off   It's schwifty time today  Hmm.<br/> Please be kind to us, for we are but tiny things with entire bodies, stuck to your ground.<br/> I like what you got! Good job! - Yeah! - Whoo! We did it! What do you know? He was right! - Hooray Principal Vagina! - Yeah, I'll take it.<br/> Now, hold on a second! Let's be rational about this.<br/> No, I'm-- I'm just saying, we don't know there's a cause-effect relationship-- Oh, my God! - What is going on now?! - Whoa! Whoa!  What the hell happened? Mr.<br/> President, you're gonna want to see this.<br/> I think planet Earth has just been transported.<br/> The head has left and sent its children.<br/> Holy crap! Oh, dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion.<br/> It will never happen again.<br/> Oh, dear-- Oh, dear giant head Sir, we started picking up on a garbled signal.<br/> We're decrypting it now.<br/> We asked them to show us what they got, and they did.<br/> Now we'll see which of them has got the most.<br/> 24 hours, 5 planets, 5 songs.<br/> But in the end, there can only be one Planet music! All participation is involuntary.<br/> Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray.<br/> Uh, it's probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.<br/> Welcome back to ""Planet Music""! First up, let's hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops', The Greeby Bobes! Show me what you got! Hold it, hold it.<br/> Stop.<br/> Music isn't about competition or captivity.<br/> If you love music, you love freedom.<br/> Let these worlds be free! Please! Disqualified.<br/> There's one every season.<br/> Moving on to planet Arboles Mentirosos.<br/> Arbolian Mentirososians, show us what you got! A 2, 3, 4! Rick, Morty, Ice-T, the timetable's moved up.<br/> Earth's on in six hours.<br/> Like we're not already under enough pressure?! - Whoa! Whoa! - Yeah! Geez, Morty, the guy's just doing his job.<br/> Take it easy.<br/> Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We've got six hours to come up with a song! Genius happens in the moment, Morty.<br/> Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them-- With u-- With us if we lose? That's planning for failure, Morty.<br/> Even dumber than regular planning.<br/> Balls.<br/> Morty, Morty, stop.<br/> Listen.<br/> There's only so much charge left in this thing.<br/> If we portal home from here and back, we're not gonna have enough charge left to get off world.<br/> - Get it? - What?! - Yeah.<br/> - You see? I try to shelter you from certain realities, Morty, because if I let you make me nervous, then we can't get schwifty.<br/> Stop saying it like it's a thing! You made it up! Hey, Morty, could you lick my Balls, balls Rick, cut it out! It's not funny, Rick! I've seen enough.<br/> These guys are one-hit wonders.<br/> And what's your plan, general? We still have the nuclear option.<br/> On my word, we can launch a missile at every one of those heads in the sky.<br/> Our planet's held captive on a live game show, and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, general.<br/> Until then, I'll put mine in Rick and Morty.<br/> ""Get Schwifty"" was a jam.<br/> Hello? Yes, sir, yeah.<br/> Eh, thank you, sir.<br/> Thank you.<br/> He says he's proud of what we're doing and hopes we have a great ascension festival! - Happy ascension! - Happy ascension! We should pack up and leave town now.<br/> I think it's inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream.<br/> If you'd stop being such an Evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.<br/> Whoa! Look at you! You're wearing the hat and everything! Here's yours! Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight? Yeah, sure.<br/> Wait.<br/> What? I love you guys.<br/> You gave me life.<br/> And it's the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.<br/> Dinner sounds nice.<br/> Pardon, Mr.<br/> and Mrs.<br/> Smith.<br/> Summer, are you coming to the ascension? Father, can we please go to the ascension? Sure! Let's go to the ascension.<br/> Wh-wh-what is it? We hereby send these unwantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies.<br/> Headward, free now to rise.<br/> Headward, free now to rise.<br/> Headward, free now to rise.<br/> Oh, yes! Yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free! And squeegee comes up from the garage, right? But he's got a lobster in one hand, the movie tickets in the other, he's like, ""I'm ready!"" You gonna take a lobster to see ""Iron Man 3""? Ice-T! Ah, damn.<br/> We're out of original-flavor fig Newtons.<br/> I should get going anyway.<br/> Wait, wait, wait! C-come on.<br/> H-hold on a second.<br/> Hold on.<br/> - What?! - Damn.<br/> You didn't tell me you [bleep.]<br/> around with portals and shit.<br/> That's it! Whoa, whoa, Morty! Give me that.<br/> You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down! Morty, just put it down.<br/> You don't know what you're doing.<br/> I'm going to go find mom and dad! No! Oh [bleep.]<br/>! Oh [bleep.]<br/>.<br/>  Oh [bleep.]<br/>.<br/> And then Ethan played guitar, and we learned the seven contemplations of the head by singing them.<br/> It was really fun.<br/> Praise be the head! Praise be the Yeah.<br/> Hi, folks.<br/> Head Priest Vagina.<br/> Thanks for farming all those potatoes.<br/> It's 6:00 P.<br/>M.<br/>, so if you're a parent, you're now entitled to adoration from your children.<br/> I'm going to start dinner! I don't know what to say.<br/> Summer is doing really well here.<br/> She's aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become.<br/> She's not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew.<br/> Please help me.<br/> You can reach me if you try.<br/> Please help me! That's not our business as long as Summer is thriving.<br/> Taco time! I hope it pleases you as the head desires.<br/> That's wonderful, Summer.<br/> We're so proud of you.<br/> But obviously you don't have to make dinner every night.<br/> Of course I do, silly! Oh, my God, daddy! I'm sorry I called you silly! I'm so sorry! Heavenly heads and cranial creator, forgive my transgressions against family and community.<br/> May my chores complete me as I complete them.<br/>  - Morty.<br/> - Birdperson? You appear to be dying.<br/> I will make efforts to prevent this but can promise nothing.<br/> Wh-what do you think, ice? Probably a little overdeveloped.<br/> Shit, overdeveloped, underdeveloped-- A bad song's a bad song.<br/> Well, do you think, maybe-- Could you give me some help with it, or? Aw, hell no, man.<br/> You do your thing, but I can't afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame.<br/> You know what I'm saying? Ice, I don't want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but if Morty doesn't come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it's, uh, you know, kind of your problem, too.<br/> Pfft! I ain't worried about no earth blowing up, man.<br/> What? Why not? Yo, this is why.<br/> What the [bleep.]<br/> you can turn into ice? My story begins at the dawn of time in the faraway realm of alphabetrium.<br/> There, every being is a letter of the alphabet.<br/> But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything.<br/> Earth is just one of my many stops on a lifelong journey with no destination.<br/> So you better believe I don't care if it blows up, because I'll just be ice floating through space, like a comet.<br/> Take it from me, ice, you can't just float around space not caring about stuff forever.<br/> Pfft.<br/> Man, watch me.<br/> Good luck, Rick.<br/> Okay, things are getting out of hand.<br/> I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to get schwifty.<br/> Oh, for God's sakes.<br/> That's enough.<br/> What the hell are you doing, Nathan?! I'm the goddamn president of the United [bleep.]<br/> States! I'm setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into earth's performance.<br/> And you, Mr.<br/> President I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun.<br/> Wait, wait, wait.<br/> Why-- why-- I believe I can access the history of Rick's gun and help you get back to him.<br/> But can you help me get to my family? You know, at-- at my house? Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.<br/> All of Rick's moves are dick moves! What-- What am I eating? Wh-what is this, bird-- birdseed? It is random debris.<br/> I found it in my carpet.<br/> I don't know what humans eat.<br/> - You know what this human eats.<br/> - Don't be gross, Tammy.<br/> Bird [bleep.]<br/>.<br/> Tammy, gross.<br/> Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn't care about anyone but himself.<br/> He doesn't think about the consequences of anything he does.<br/> And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds.<br/> And he is the reason you and I know each other And the reason I'm alive at all.<br/>  What's that? Who's that baby? Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick.<br/> I could give your loved ones shelter on birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers.<br/> How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick? That was Chunkytunk with ""Full Ming Mong, Empty Gorbdork.<br/>"" Up next, planet Earth! Oh, God! We're up?! Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example of what headism has to offer the world.<br/> - The world? - Headism is a hit.<br/> We're taking it worldwide, and we'd like Jerry to be our church's head of advertising.<br/> You would? Beth, we'd like to promote you from horse surgeon straight past human surgeon to head of medicine.<br/> That's my dream! That's my dream.<br/> Thank you.<br/> This is all so overwhelming.<br/> But, uh - We can't.<br/> - Absolutely not.<br/> I'm sorry? We've been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be our daughter, not this person she's become.<br/> We'll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs, outside of a potato-based religion.<br/> And you know what? I-I'm sick of pretending that we're together because of the kids in the first place.<br/> I married you because you're the love of my life.<br/> And I'm lucky to have you, and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family.<br/> Please don't do this! Please don't do this! - Summer! - Summer, listen carefully.<br/> I stole a paper clip, and I have it in my cheek, but I don't know what to do with it, and it hurts.<br/> You're going to be okay.<br/> You will come back as babies.<br/> I am a baby! I'm a baby now! Hello? Is anybody here? Mr.<br/> President! This is bluebird! Code tango niner Alpha! Abort launch! Abort! Hello? He's blocked me out.<br/> Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty! It won't matter how schwifty you get, Morty.<br/> The general's got nukes set to launch halfway through earth's song! Oh, my God! Uh, c-can you fly a black hawk? Can the pope's [bleep.]<br/> fit through a doughnut? Uh, I'm Not sure.<br/> Exactly.<br/> Show me what you got! Uh  Lapoo lapoo lapoo dops   Napoo napoo napoo nots  Headward, free now to rise.<br/> Hey, look at the heads! Looks like the heads are getting angry! I'm really bad at this, Morty! There are way too many buttons in this thing! Mr.<br/> President, if I've learned one thing today it's that sometimes you have to not give a [bleep.]<br/>!  Napoo napoo nots  Ugh.<br/> Tough crowd.<br/> I'm sure that has-- That has nothing to do with this.<br/> The heads are displeased! Summer! Um Morty! Hooray! Hooray! Look! Hooray! The heads love this! They love it when we don't kill the Smith family! No! Stop that! You're not allowed to interpret the will of the heads! Call off the nuclear strike! This is the president! Stop the nuclear missile launch! Just launch the missiles! Boo! Not cool! I'm the only one that speaks to the heads! Disqualified! The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him! Disqualified! Disqualified!  Ice-T?! That's right.<br/> It's me-- Ice-T.<br/> I care now.<br/> You made me care more.<br/> With all due respect, I'd like to hear what Rick and Morty have to play.<br/> What do you say, Rick? I say, let's do it! Hooray! Yeah.<br/> All right.<br/> -  Oh, yeah  - Uh-huh.<br/> Here we go.<br/>  Oh, yeah   Say it with me   Head bent over   Raised up posterior   Oh, yeah   Head bent over   Yeah, raised up posterior  Sing it with me now! Oh, my go--  Head bent over  Yeah.<br/>  Raised up posterior  All right!  Head bent over  Oh, yeah.<br/> Raised up posterior! After 988 seasons of ""Planet Music"", the cromulons have decided to declare earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion.<br/> Goodbye.<br/> - Yeah! - We did it! Yes! Let's get a music album now! Did he just say ""musical reality show""? Yeah, it's possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren't actually related at all.<br/> Help! We should go get him.<br/> I hope I can call on you and Rick again if I need you, Morty.<br/> Sure thing.<br/> And I-- I was kind of hoping that I could get a selfie with you? Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, we'll deny it and probably worse.<br/> Understood.<br/> D-i-i-i-i-ie! Oh, no, no, no! Why didn't he turn into a snake? Trade secret, Mr.<br/> President.<br/> Particle beam in a wristwatch, snake holster on the leg.<br/> I love this man!  Magnesium-J, Hydrogen-F Father.<br/> Word of your selfless acts on the Earth planet have traveled across the galaxy.<br/> I have changed.<br/> I am ready to rejoin my brethren on alphabetrium.<br/> Very well.<br/> Your exile ends today.<br/> Welcome home, Water-T.<br/> The numbericons! They're attacking! Battle stations! Aah! Father! I love you, son.<br/> I should have never turned you to ice.<br/> Water-T, where are you going?! There's too many of them! Then I better crunch the numbers.<br/> Aaaaaaaaaaaah!   <br/>

Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth with a ""Ball Fondlers"" movie franchise.<br/> I can't believe the things this reality considers PG-13.<br/> - Yeah.<br/> I-I'm pretty jealous.<br/> - Don't be, Morty.<br/> There's pros and cons to every alternate timeline fun facts about this one-- It's got giant, telepathic spiders, 11 9/11s, and the best ice cream in the multiverse! - Shut up! - We go get some ice cream, mother[bleep.]<br/>! Oh, great.<br/> Oh, boy.<br/> W-what's wrong, Rick? Is it the quantum carburetor or something? ""Quantum carburetor""? Jesus, Morty.<br/> You can't just add a-- Sci-Fi word to a car word and hope it means something.<br/> Huh, looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery.<br/> - We're gonna have to go inside.<br/> - Um, go inside what? The battery, Morty.<br/> Be right back, Summer.<br/> Stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel spidery.<br/> Wait! You can't leave me here! You'll be fine.<br/> Ship, keep Summer safe.<br/> Keep Summer safe.<br/> Ohh! Ugh.<br/> Wonderful.<br/> Hey, excuse me.<br/> Hello.<br/> Um What, you think you're better than me?! Nobody's better than me! Hey! Hey! Aah! Aaaaah! - Keep Summer safe.<br/> - Aaaaaaah! Hey, man, what the hell?! That was my daughter's pediatrician! Aah! No, stop! Don't kill him! Confirmed.<br/> Aah! Oh, God.<br/> I can't feel my legs.<br/> Help! Help!! - Summer is safe.<br/> - I don't feel safe.<br/> Confirmed.<br/> No.<br/> Oh, God, help me.<br/> Help me! Help me, please! You can help me!  Oh, man.<br/> Where are we, Rick? Morty, remember eight seconds ago when when you said, ""Go inside what?"" And I said, ""The battery""? And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like, ""Whoa, this is unexpected.<br/> This is not what I was expecting, Morty.<br/> - What a perplexing mystery this is.<br/>"" - All right, all right.<br/> We're inside the battery.<br/> I get it.<br/> - You don't have to bust my balls.<br/> - Huh, this isn't right.<br/> This pipe's supposed to be sending up to the engine, Morty.<br/> Instead we've got zero? Now what are these people doing? W-w-w-whoa, people? It's time for some hands-on engine repair.<br/> - All right, Morty, hold on to something.<br/> - Whoa! Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick.<br/> T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something.<br/> Thanks, Morty.<br/> I'm pretty proud of this bad boy.<br/> Check it out.<br/> I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life.<br/> I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale.<br/> And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff.<br/> You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery.<br/> It's society.<br/> They work for each other, Morty.<br/> They pay each other.<br/> They buy houses.<br/> They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power.<br/> That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.<br/> Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college.<br/> It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano.<br/> But why has Rick returned? And what will he say when he hears the big news? Let's find out.<br/> You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick.<br/> It's messed up.<br/> There's caterers down there.<br/> Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes.<br/> Would you relax, Morty? There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing.<br/> Now slap on these antennae.<br/> - These people need to think we're aliens.<br/> - What? Why? Obviously you really know nothing about car repair.<br/> Wait for the ramp, Morty.<br/> They love the slow ramp.<br/> Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down.<br/> Greetings! Morty, you got to flip them off.<br/> I told them it means ""Peace among worlds.<br/>"" How hilarious is that? Coming through.<br/> Two real aliens walking through here.<br/> Rick, our alien friend.<br/> Uh, Mr.<br/> President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power.<br/> That's correct.<br/> We've evolved.<br/> Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete.<br/> I would love to see it.<br/> [Bleep.]<br/> you.<br/> What did you say to me?! ""[Bleep.]<br/> you.<br/>"" Y-you told me it means ""much obliged"".<br/> Oh.<br/> Right.<br/> Uh, b-blow me.<br/> No, no, no.<br/> Blow me.<br/> Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars.<br/> I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11.<br/> Fix it or it's your ass.<br/> Chris, I'm in the middle of something.<br/> Zeep, is Rick-- The alien.<br/> Rick the alien.<br/> Rick the alien Really? You're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization.<br/> Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving.<br/> They teach kids about me in school.<br/> I dropped out of school.<br/> It's not a place for smart people.<br/> Ohhhh, snap! Listen to me, you arrogant little-- R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source.<br/> I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep.<br/> Fine.<br/> It's hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power.<br/> I call it a miniverse.<br/> Dumb name.<br/> - Excuse me? - Nothing.<br/> I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this.<br/> Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside? This isn't a [bleep.]<br/> chocolate factory.<br/> I don't have time.<br/> Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world? Yes, Chris.<br/> Thanks for reminding me of that.<br/> Great president.<br/> All right, let's go.<br/> Whoa-oh! Hold on to something.<br/> I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed.<br/> I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank.<br/> What they don't know is that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us.<br/> No more gooble boxes.<br/> I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical.<br/> - It's not cool.<br/> - What?! Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away making your power.<br/> I mean, that's what I call slavery.<br/> No, no, no, they work for each other in exchange for money, which they then-- Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps.<br/> Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college.<br/> Rick, a word? What the hell was that? I know.<br/> ""Eek barba dirkle""? That's a pretty [bleep.]<br/> up ""ooh-la-la"".<br/> No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here? Holy crap.<br/> You're right, Morty.<br/> Hypocrisy.<br/> Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that mother[bleep.]<br/> ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up.<br/> Wh-wh-why are you making that face? Holy [bleep.]<br/>! It's me.<br/> I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler from another world.<br/> You don't think that's overdoing it a little? I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind.<br/> You know what? I shouldn't be so critical.<br/> I'm an alien.<br/> Places, please.<br/> We're about to land.<br/> Too fast.<br/> Law enforcement converging on location.<br/> Keep Summer safe.<br/> No! No, no! Don't hurt anybody! Confirm custom defense protocol-- Keep Summer safe-- No physical force.<br/> - Yes.<br/> - Processing.<br/> Come out of the vehicle with your hands in the air! Scanning assailants.<br/> Psychological option detected.<br/> Gestating.<br/> ""Gestating""? Come out with your hands up, or we will be forced to open fire! - Incoming! - We got a device! Bomb! Bomb! Daddy? Oh, my God.<br/> - Hunter? - Daddy? What the hell? Jesus Christ, cease fire! Stay back! H-h-hunter? - Daddy.<br/> - Hunter! Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter.<br/> Oh, my boy.<br/> My boy.<br/> I'm sorry.<br/> I'm sorry.<br/> It was all my fault.<br/> - I'm sorry.<br/> - Daddy, leave the car alone.<br/> W-w-w-what? Leave the car alone.<br/> Hunter? Don't-- Oh, my God.<br/> Stay here, Hunter! No! God, no! Hunter! All of you have loved ones.<br/> All can be returned.<br/> All can be taken away.<br/> Please step away from the vehicle.<br/> Keep Summer safe.<br/> And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks, I will bring you other great alien advancements.<br/> - Hey, uh, let me ask you something.<br/> - Yes? Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new? All of them.<br/> That's their job.<br/> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br/> But I mean, like, energy-wise.<br/> Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box? How do you know about that? It's top secret.<br/> So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough.<br/> Crank it.<br/> I told them this means ""Peace among worlds"".<br/> - How hilarious is that? - Re-really funny, Zeep.<br/> Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you.<br/> It's not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I'll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device I call a blooble yank.<br/> But what they won't know is-- You'll be taking most of their energy.<br/> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br/> I get it.<br/> It's showtime.<br/> You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete? This is wrong, Kyle.<br/> What you're doing is wrong.<br/> You're basically-- This is slavery.<br/> You're talking about creating a planet of slaves.<br/> - Told you, Zeep.<br/> - Oh, they won't be slaves.<br/> They'll work for each other and pay each other money.<br/> That just sounds like slavery with ex tra steps.<br/> - What? - Wait a minute.<br/> Did you create my universe? Is my universe a miniverse? - Microverse! - Uh, teenyverse.<br/> Ugh! You bastard! Much obliged.<br/> - What the hell is happening? - This is healthy, trust me.<br/> You're my battery, mother[bleep.]<br/>.<br/> That's all you are.<br/> I made you.<br/> Your microverse sucks! And your miniverse is the size of a [bleep.]<br/> lobster tank! It's whack! Are they not really aliens? Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know? So he made a universe, and that guy is from that universe.<br/> And that guy made a universe.<br/> And that's the universe where I was born.<br/> Where my father died.<br/> Where I couldn't make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe.<br/> - I made you! - Yeah.<br/> Science, huh? Ain't it a thing.<br/> You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand.<br/> You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know? She's a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know? Because she-- she'll-- She bucks pretty hard.<br/> Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no! - Teenyverse.<br/> - Teenyverse.<br/> Come on, come on, come on.<br/> Pterodactyl! Asshole! When I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it.<br/> Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse and then the microverse around that, and guess what? Don't make things worse, Rick! Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe.<br/> You know, we-- We need it to start our car.<br/> That's what you used my universe for? To run your car? Yeah, but don't flatter yourself.<br/> There's always AAA, you [bleep.]<br/> [bleep.]<br/>sucker! What's he doing? What's he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality! You crafty son of a-- Ow! I crafted the guy that created the planet you're standing on! Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries! I didn't ask to be born! All right, that's it! I'm out.<br/> I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people.<br/> - It can't be worse than this.<br/> - Sure.<br/> Okay, Morty.<br/> Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you.<br/> That's a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth? It's a prehistoric planet, Morty.<br/> Someone has to bring a little culture.<br/> And it certainly can't be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights! Go, go, go! Oh, my God.<br/> Oh, God.<br/> What are we going to do now? I am unable to destroy this army.<br/> To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army, - but you will not permit it.<br/> - Correct.<br/> You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures.<br/> If you're talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that.<br/> Confirmed.<br/> I am currently constructing a security measure in compliance with your parameters.<br/> But I do want to say you are not making this easy.<br/> You know you're kind of a dick, right? My function is to keep Summer safe, not keep Summer being, like, totally stoked about, like, the general vibe and stuff.<br/> That's you.<br/> That's how you talk.<br/> Hey, that's my deer! Aaaaaaah! Raah! I hope your God is as big a dick as you.<br/> My God's the biggest dick that's never existed.<br/> Why do you think I'm even here? You're here because you created someone smarter than you.<br/> Oh, I thought we were both here because I created a universe of idiots.<br/> Kalo kada sha la.<br/> Holy shit.<br/> Morty? I haven't seen you in months.<br/> You're leading the tree people? Huh.<br/> That's a step up.<br/> We have no leaders.<br/> We follow only the will of the forest.<br/> Ooh.<br/> Wow.<br/> - Gaaaaay.<br/> - That is pretty gay.<br/> You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing.<br/> Come with me into the forest.<br/> There is something I wish to teach you.<br/> This is ku'ala, the spirit tree.<br/> For generations, it has guided the-- You have to get us the [bleep.]<br/> out of here.<br/> These people are backwards savages.<br/> They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger.<br/> Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time.<br/> I m-- I miss my family.<br/> I miss my laptop.<br/> I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day! Look, I don't care what it takes.<br/> You two are putting aside your bull[bleep.]<br/>, and you're working together to get us back home.<br/> No can do, Morty.<br/> I just can't.<br/> I just don't see how I can-- Ro ro dah no gah! You're smart.<br/> You'll figure it out.<br/> You have 10 seconds to get out of the ship! All right, not bad.<br/> I guess you're an okay proto recombinator.<br/> I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination.<br/> If this works, drinks are on me.<br/> If drinks are on you, you're gonna need a second mortgage on that tower.<br/> I'm an alcoholic.<br/> Opium addict.<br/> All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up.<br/> You guys are the [bleep.]<br/> worst! Your gods are a lie! [Bleep.]<br/> you, [bleep.]<br/> nature, and [bleep.]<br/> trees! Yes! You did it! Yes! Hey, uh, how about that drink? Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship.<br/> Isour wallet in your ship? That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with? It's cool.<br/> I'll be back in a sec.<br/> You know how long a second can take in a microverse? Oh! Run, Morty! That asshole's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me! He's psychotic! - Morty, hop on my back.<br/> - Why? Go, go Sanchez ski shoes.<br/> Aaaaaah! Eight Aaaah! Oof! Hold still.<br/> Oh, hey, guys.<br/> I just finished cooking us a feast.<br/> Aaaah! Holy-- - You monster! - Whoa.<br/> Bad tour.<br/> seven Hey, you got to sign out.<br/> Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie! If that were really true, then - I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.<br/> - Third floor.<br/> Would you like to go to dinner with-- Uh, no.<br/> You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it.<br/> [Bleep.]<br/> What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed.<br/> He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us! Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car.<br/> What?! A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car.<br/> - Oh, my God! - Concentrate, Morty.<br/> Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty.<br/> Never mind.<br/> Here's a taxi.<br/> Get in.<br/> It's fine.<br/> six - Hey, Zeep.<br/> - Huh? Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.<br/> Aaah! We did it, Morty.<br/> Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe.<br/> Excuse me? five-- Sir? - Holy hell.<br/> - Sir! Hold you fire! What's going on? I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government.<br/> Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace.<br/> We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption.<br/> Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs.<br/> What do we do about the space car? Leave it alone.<br/> I mean, what did it really do, anyways? Kill a guy and paralyze his buddy? Not a bad trade for spider peace.<br/> All right, that's it.<br/> Move out! I love this spider! Summer is safe.<br/> All right, I get it.<br/> Rick! Don't do it.<br/> You quit school, but you still got some learning to do.<br/> Aah! Unh! Class dismissed.<br/> Geez.<br/> - You all right? - Uh-huh! What are you doing, Rick? I'm pretty sure the battery's dead.<br/> Oh, you think so, huh, Morty? Well, let's see.<br/> Hey, wait-- huh? I don't get it.<br/> Of course you don't.<br/> But Zeep did.<br/> He knew that once I got back to my car, one of two things was gonna happen-- I was gonna have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken.<br/> Peace among worlds, Rick.<br/> Jesus.<br/> Yeah.<br/> Listen to that baby purr.<br/> You were right, Morty-- We really just needed to be honest with those guys.<br/> All right, here we go.<br/> Thank y-o-o-ou.<br/> See, Morty? This is what it's all about.<br/> This is why we do what we do.<br/> - Uh-huh.<br/> - Ew! What the hell? Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream.<br/> Presidential decree-- All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs.<br/> - What the [bleep.]<br/> did you do, Summer?! - It was your ship! - Your stupid ship did it! - Don't blame my ship! - It melted a child! - My ship doesn't do anything - It killed it itself! - unless it's told to do something! - We almost died! - I don't want to hear it, Summer! Your boobs are all hanging about, and you ruined ice cream with your boobs out.<br/> And don't even try to deny it, either.<br/> Did you get any of that? It's a good show.<br/> <br/>

<|endoftext|>

What's new at school? - Nothing.<br/> Nothing! Oh, uh, one of the lunch ladies died.<br/> They found her in the gym with, like, two holes in her neck and all the blood drained out of her.<br/> Good lord! Who does something like that? Obviously a vampire.<br/> W-w-where's the pepper? Wait, what?! Vampires are real?! Yes, Summer, vampires are real.<br/> Who knew? Oh, right, all humanity, for hundreds of years, now.<br/> Yeah, Summer, it's a big universe.<br/> Get used to it.<br/> R-right, Rick? Well, what are we going to do?! We're gonna live our lives until we die.<br/> Possibly by vampire.<br/> More likely auto accident or heart disease, but possibly vampire.<br/> Grandpa Rick, couldn't you, like, use your superknowledge to turn yourself into a teenager and come to our school and help us hunt the vampire down? Um wow.<br/> Yeah, pretty specific pitch, Summer.<br/> I probably could turn myself into a teenager and hang out in the zit-covered, hormone-addled, low-stakes assworld that is high school.<br/> But here's my reverse-ask Why in the [Bleep.]<br/> would I ever do that, ever? And how dare you even ask me that? And why aren't you more ashamed of yourself? Dad! Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie.<br/> Jerry! Do you know what you just said to our daughter? Sor-ry! I wasn't paying attention.<br/> To a conversation about vampires?! Clearly, I didn't know it was about vampires, because I wasn't paying attention, which you would know, if you ever paid attention to me! Oh, here we go, right to the victim role.<br/> Am I a victim, Beth, or am I married to a mean, unfair monster that always hurts me?! Jesus Christ! Will you fix your marriage or get a divorce already? Well, we tried a couples' therapist.<br/> That's earth therapy.<br/> You might as well ask a horse to fix a merry-go-round.<br/> I mean, he'll try his best, but mostly, he's just gonna get horrified.<br/> I know about a place off-planet with a 100% success rate.<br/> Well, we want to make it work, if we can.<br/> It's just - then it's settled.<br/> No need to pack.<br/> - Oh! Let's go, go, go, go! Do you think mom and dad are, you know, gonna get a divorce? I think it's okay to dream, Morty.<br/> I'm gonna go make some wooden stakes.<br/> I booked you for a two-day intensive at nuptia four, the galaxy's most successful couples' counseling institute.<br/> They could save the marriage of a dog and a bar of dark chocolate.<br/> They could save the marriage of a porn star and a porn star.<br/> Well, I know I'm ready to try whatever it takes.<br/> Which clearly implies that I'm not.<br/> It's not a competition, Beth.<br/> Oh is that how you're gonna try to win, by implying I'm competitive? If the shoe fits.<br/> My shoe fits up your ass.<br/> You wish! Okay, have fun.<br/> See ya Thursday! Oh! Jerk.<br/> Don't insult my father.<br/> He's the reason our kids are only half-stupid.<br/> Ha! You just called yourself Oh.<br/> Beth and Jerry Smith? Yes.<br/> I'm glaxo slimslom.<br/> Welcome to nuptia four.<br/> Your marriage can rest easy now.<br/> Jerry, go ahead and sit there and put this on.<br/> This machine isolates the part of the subject's brain containing all perceptions of its romantic partner.<br/> And we will now render Jerry's perception of Beth with artificial biological life.<br/> Interesting.<br/> What the hell is that?! Take that back! You do not think that about me! I didn't do anything! They scanned it out of my brain.<br/> Can I take it back? There's nothing to regret.<br/> We're dealing with unconscious, unhealthy thoughts.<br/> Beth.<br/> Now, we scan for Beth's perceptions of Jerry.<br/> Scan hard.<br/> He's dead to me.<br/> Everything's dead to you.<br/> What? Nothing.<br/> Read it and weep, bitch.<br/> Does everybody see what I mean? I think we all see what you both mean.<br/> Any leads on the vampire? No, Summer! I mean, you know, I think it might be time that we just l-let it go.<br/> Oh, so, now, you're too cool for this, just because grandpa Rick is? It's not that, it's just that the universe is a little too big to care about something so small.<br/> Aah! What up, my Helsings? Who wants to hunt a vampire? Ha ha ha! Rick? How how did you Yeah, I got bored and then, I remembered, this morning, how I blew Summer off, and I thought, ""hey, why are you such a grumpy douche, Rick? Go to the garage, transfer your mind into a younger clone of yourself, and get embroiled in some youthful hijinks, what's the bfd?"" So here I am.<br/> I'm tiny Rick! O-o-okay.<br/> Well, it's good you're here, Rick.<br/> I was pretty sure we didn't have what it takes to deal with a bloodsucker on our own.<br/> Don't short-sell yourself, Summer.<br/> You got everything it takes.<br/> But it'll still be fun to do this as a [Bleep.]<br/> team, mother[Bleep.]<br/> tiny Rick! Yeah! Oh, my God, Toby Matthews! Hey, Toby.<br/> I'm tiny Rick.<br/> I'm new.<br/> Hey oh go easy on me.<br/> Ha ha.<br/> Just kiddin'.<br/> I like your straightforward style and that lab coat's pretty cool.<br/> Summer.<br/> He knows my name! Why wouldn't he? You're great! But, listen, just be careful.<br/> We can't rule anybody out as the vampire, not even the dreamboats.<br/> Stop, tiny Rick.<br/> Huntin' a vampire with my grandkids! [Bleep.]<br/>! Tiny Ri-I-ck! The next step is to watch your mythologues interact together and, uh big surprise It's never pretty.<br/> Here we have garrrh and zharbidar gloompfschs, or, should I say, here we have the way garrrh and zharbidar perceive each other.<br/> As we can all see, this is hardly the real garrrh and zharbidar.<br/> Which is good, because the relationship in their heads is not only ugly, it's unsustainable.<br/> You may already be learning something important All of these relationships are different, none of them are real, and none of them work.<br/> We are not the monsters we sometimes see each other as, because we are real and we are functional.<br/> That's what makes us better than them.<br/> We can find solutions.<br/> We can adapt.<br/> We can communicate.<br/> And, most importantly, we can work together.<br/> Well, it was a tough adventure, but it paid off Our school is vampire-free! Man, who would've suspected coach feratu? You did great, guys.<br/> Couldn't have done it without ya.<br/> You know, we w-we should be proud of ourselves.<br/> We killed a vampire and a gym teacher.<br/> Ha ha ha.<br/> Talk about two-for-one, right?! So, how, exactly, is your old body living in there, grandpa Rick? Oh, you know, hyperbaric quantum fluid, That kind of thing.<br/> It preserves living tissue.<br/> Not that there was much to preserve.<br/> Look at that mummy! Ha! Ha ha! And I guess it's time for me to get back inside the old-timer.<br/> Oh, my God.<br/> Toby Matthews is asking if my parents are still out of town and if we can have a party! All right, way to go, Summer! What did I tell you? Ohh! He's asking if tiny Rick will be here.<br/> Well, you know what, Summer? Tell him tiny Rick will be here! And tell him to bring some brews! For real? Y-y-y-you would stay as tiny Rick, just so we can have a party? Hell, yeah! What's one more night? And who can have fun with this old bastard hanging around, huh? Wubby lubby doob doob! Whoo! - Tiny Rick! Moving on.<br/> Now, we have Beth and Jerry Smith from the planet e-arth.<br/> My heart is pounding.<br/> This is gonna be great.<br/> The e-arth relationships are simpler.<br/> It's a primitive planet, so their dysfunctions are oh W-wait, what? What's going on? Where are the Smith mythologues? Oh, my God.<br/> Aah! Aah! Oh, my God.<br/> Secure the cell! Aaaah! Uh, hey! You know what's fun? Our gift shop.<br/> Why don't we proceed in an orderly Oh, dear God, no.<br/> They're codependent! Run! Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah, you really know how to sport that color blue.<br/> Really? You're looking real good.<br/> Oh, my God.<br/> Hey, Morty.<br/> Oh, hey hey, Jessica.<br/> So, is tiny Rick your brother or cousin, or? No, my grandpa just transferred his consciousness into a clone of himself so he could be in our high school.<br/> Cool.<br/> Hey, tiny Rick's playing guitar.<br/> All right, everybody.<br/> This next one's coming straight from the heart.<br/> Making the lyrics up right off the top of my head.<br/>  Let me out  what you see is not the same person as me   My life's a lie  I'm not who you're looking at   Let me out, set me free  I'm really old; This isn't me   My real body's slowly dyin' in a vat   Is anybody listening'  can anyone understand?  Stop lookin' at me like that and actually help me   Help me!  Help me; I'm gonna die! Tiny Rick! Thanks, everybody! This guy's amazing! I love tiny Rick! Bad.<br/> Ass.<br/> - Yeah! Aah! Huh? What the [Bleep.]<br/>? Yeah, I know! What kind of operation are you running? Us?! What the hell kind of relationship do you have?! Oh, right, blame this on us.<br/> Okay, uh, I can and I am! Your demonized mythologizations of each other are cooperating.<br/> Isn't that good? No.<br/> No! It's bad! You have the single worst marriage I've ever witnessed.<br/> It shouldn't exist! You should never, ever, ever, have gotten together and I do not understand how, or why, you would ever stay together.<br/> Aaah! Well, this is just bad couples' therapy.<br/> Totally.<br/> Wait for us! There's only room for one more.<br/> I'm a therapist.<br/> I'll talk to them.<br/> They're not therapists.<br/> Go, go, go! There's gotta be a way to contact my dad.<br/> Let's find a control room or something.<br/> Beth! You'll want to see this.<br/> What is it? It's a small, hinged panel with a tiny amount of space behind it.<br/> If you can find one, too, we should be safe for hours, maybe days! You stay put, Jerry.<br/> I'll send help, if I make it.<br/> You don't want to find your own little hatch? Jerry, I believe that, if you hide by yourself, you might survive and I believe I, by myself, have a shot of getting out of here, but the two of us, together? I don't know.<br/> Look, maybe the shrink was right.<br/> Good luck.<br/> All right, now, you listen to me.<br/> Oh! Or don't.<br/> Hey! Don't! Please! Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God! Now, I know I've said, in the past, that math is important And it is! But I also think that, one day, you'll all look back on being in high school with tiny Rick and Morty, who I hear had a great party last night.<br/> So, class dismissed.<br/> You've got the day off! All right! Good work, Mr.<br/> goldenfold! Yeah, get outside.<br/> Read a book.<br/> Put on some sunscreen, Danielle! Hey, what's up, Summer? Ooh, nice top.<br/> Thanks.<br/> Tiny Rick, you think you might be getting back into your old body tonight? No can do.<br/> Tonight's the big dance and Morty's bringing Jessica.<br/> He needs his tiny wing man.<br/> Tiny Rick! Okay, but if not tonight, when? I don't know.<br/> When I feel like it? Damn, girl! You need to chill out! This whole thing was your idea, in the first place, and, now, you're trying to rush it along.<br/> Yeah, and you know what? I like high school.<br/> I like hanging out.<br/> Tiny Rick! But what if the you that likes it isn't you? Oh! Oh, Summer! It's just Rick in a younger body.<br/> What's the what's What's what's What's the What's the problem? Look at his art, Morty.<br/> I've got an emo streak.<br/> It's part of what makes me so rad.<br/> Why does it say ""help me Morty and Summer!""? Come on, Summer, that's the title of the art.<br/> Why was knight rider called knight rider? The car's name was kitt.<br/> Nobody rode Michael knight.<br/> You're overthinking it, Summer.<br/> I'm tiny Rick! Grandpa, I think that, when you put your mind into this body's young brain, it did what young brains do It shoved the bad thoughts into the back and put a wall around them.<br/> But those bad thoughts are the real Rick.<br/> The fact that you're old, the fact that we're all going to die, one day, the fact that the universe is so big, nothing in it matters, those facts are who you are.<br/> So you're trapped in there and you can only come out in the form of tiny Rick's teen angst! Well, Summer, I hear Toby Matthews isn't into psycho chicks.<br/> Can't think of anyone that is.<br/> I'll see you mother[Bleep.]<br/> at the dance! Tiny Rick! Morty, you have to help me! Summer, he's happy! I'm happy! I-I-is that why you're doing this, you don't want me and Rick to be happy? No.<br/> Well, then get your shit together! Get it all together and put it in a backpack.<br/> All your shit, so it's together.<br/> And if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere, you know? Take it to the shit store and sell it o-or put it in a shit museum.<br/> I don't care what you do! You just gotta get it together.<br/> Get your shit together.<br/> Get back! Wait, for real? You're how Beth sees me? Oh, my God.<br/> Turn around! I said turn around! How can Beth have these thoughts about me?! That judgmental monster bitch! I'm not taking this.<br/> I want to know where my wife is.<br/> You are going to help me.<br/> No! Nobody's doing that! Stay.<br/> What do you want? Jerrys.<br/> You want Jerry? I don't even want Jerry.<br/> I want Jerrys.<br/> Waahee! An army.<br/> An army of Jerrys.<br/> The value of his subservience is wasted on you.<br/> I will use it to dominate the universe.<br/> Ah ha ha.<br/> Boy, Jerry must think I'm pretty stupid, for you to be this stupid.<br/> Wouldn't it make more sense to put my dumb-ass husband in this chair, so you can make an army of youbadass self? There could never be more than one of me.<br/> I'm the strongest, smartest being alive because Jerry thinks you're that much stronger and smarter than you are! Okay, ouch.<br/>  Oh, hey h-hey-y! Morty, Jessica, what's up? Check out the new dance I made up.<br/> It's called ""ooh let me out!""  Let me out  let me out  this is not a dance  I'm beggin' for help  I'm screamin' for help  please come let me out  let me out  let me out  this is not a dance  I'm beggin' for help  I'm screamin' for help  please come let me out  I'm dyin' in a vat  in the gara-a-ge - Awesome! Okay, that last part was really weird.<br/> Maybe Summer's on to something here.<br/> I don't know.<br/> It was fun.<br/> You want to slow dance? Tiny Rick, hey, great dancing as usual.<br/> Moment of your time? Tiny Rick, this conversation is gonna break my heart wide open.<br/> You're a great student and the fact that you're an 80-year-old man in a clone body, it never bothered me.<br/> But this here is another matter.<br/> You recognize this? We got a tip it was in your locker.<br/> Yeah, now, because the gym coach was a vampire, the school board is embarrassed and won't take it public, however, they can't have students killin' teachers.<br/> I gotta expel you for this one, tr.<br/> I'm sorry.<br/> I just got expelled, Summer! Oh! So I guess there's no need to stay young.<br/> My top! Screw your top! You ratted on me?! I'm tiny Rick! Fine! Yes! Because I love you and I'm trying to save your life! High school is my life! Summer Smith is a [Bleep.]<br/> psycho nerd and she just got me kicked out of school! Boo! Summer, I thought you were cool! I'm sorry, okay? How can you be such a bitch? Oh, my God, Morty.<br/> Your sister crossed tiny Rick? Talk about self-destructive.<br/> Yeah.<br/> Hey, Jerry-lover! How about a taste of the real thing? Jerry! Ah.<br/> Ah.<br/> Ah.<br/> Ah ah ah ah ah aah aah.<br/> Not on my watch.<br/> That's it! Beth, it's me, your husband! I'm here to save you.<br/> Or my name isn't Jerry Smith! Aha! - Yes! Jerry Smith! Yeah, here.<br/> - Aha! Okay, fair enough.<br/> Say goodnight, old man.<br/> What the hell are you doing?! - Put it down! Summer, you bitch! Don't talk to her that way! She's your granddaughter! I don't need a granddaughter! I'm tiny ri-I-ck! She's my sister! And if tiny Rick is gonna be an asshole to my sister, then, you know, y-y-you may as well be old again.<br/> You think you're tough, huh, Morty? What are you gonna do? I'm tiny Rick.<br/> I'm the coolest kid in your school.<br/> How are you gonna just make me do whatever you say, huh? I'm gonna do what real Rick would do if he was here I'm gonna kick your ass! Ohhhh! Rick, I know you're in there! I know you're trying to get out! That's it, Morty! Hold him down!  Drink up, baby  stay up all night listen to it, tiny Rick.<br/> Listen to elliott Smith.<br/> Ugh! No! Feel what he's feeling.<br/> Ugh! Noooooooo! God!  That you'll never see oh, God, what is life? How can someone so talented die so young? What is being young? I'm not young.<br/> I'm old.<br/> I'm I'm gonna die.<br/> My body isn't real.<br/> Morty! Summer! It's me! It's Rick! Regular Rick! Rick! How do we get you back into your body? Okay, listen carefully.<br/> There's a set of diodes on the vat's control panel, a blue one and a red one.<br/> Oh, God, what kind of world is this? I didn't ask to be born.<br/> I need you to connect the blue one to my left temple and the red one to Why doesn't anyone really like me? Focus, grandpa! Just put the stupid wires on my head! I hate being a teenager! Ugh! Arrgghh! Ah! Uhhhhh! Jerry, you can't bend metal.<br/> Then make a me that can! How can I do that while I'm watching you totally fail to bend metal? Good old Beth! The mind of a robot and the heart of an insect! Don't talk that way about her.<br/> What? Oh, it hurts! Oh, God.<br/> Stop.<br/> This representation displeases me.<br/> Aaah! Good lord.<br/> How did you? Well, I had a feeling that, in your mind, the ideal version of me is one smart enough to see you as A goddess.<br/> Not such a stupid worm now, are you? Honey, when it comes to the subject of your ego, I'm Stephen [Bleep.]<br/> hawkinson.<br/> Ugh, it's Never mind.<br/> I love you.<br/> Ugh agh.<br/> Rick! Pants! Holy shit! Thanks, kids.<br/> You figured it out.<br/> Well, Summer did.<br/> Kind of weird that you were that willing to sell my existence out for some trim, Morty.<br/> What?! Pants! But listen I forgive you both because you know what? I learned, today, something important The teenage mind is its own worst enemy.<br/> Oh, I also learned this Operation Phoenix is not the fallback I thought it would be.<br/> I guess it's back to the drawing board.<br/> Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God.<br/> Put some pants on! Put pants on.<br/> Grandpa's back, baby! Grandpa's Oh, man, I gotta pick up your parents.<br/> They have been blowin' me up.<br/> One last swing for the road! Aaaaaaaaaaah! For the love of God, get dressed! So, what do you think? You wanna keep this marriage going a while longer? At least until Morty has graduated high school.<br/> Oh.<br/> Mm.<br/> Aha, you see? What did I tell you two? It worked.<br/> You know what, Rick? I guess, in a way Already lost interest.<br/> Get in the car.<br/> I've been inside a kid all day and, now, I can feel my bones scraping each other.<br/> Uh, just so you're prepared, there's a bunch of dead mes in the garage.<br/> Huh! Sounds like our stories were connected by a theme.<br/> Not really, Jerry.<br/> Probably a cosmetic connection your mind mistakes for thematic.<br/> Oh.<br/> Old Rick! Ruinin' everything!  Master.<br/> Speak.<br/> Coach feratu's presence was discovered by the humans.<br/> He has been destroyed.<br/> No bother.<br/> The mortals shall soon I'm sorry, what did you say his name was? Coach feratu.<br/> Coach feratu.<br/> That was his real name, like his actual vampire name? No no no no.<br/> His vampire name was balik alistane.<br/> Why the [Bleep.]<br/> would he name himself after a famous vampire movie? Was he doing a bit? I do not know, your unholiness.<br/> Jesus [Bleep.]<br/> Christ.<br/> From now on, no more of this clever-name bullshit.<br/> When a vampire is pretending to be a human, they can just call themselves Alan Jefferson or something like that.<br/> It's crazy, right? I mean, am I being an asshole? Okay, I feel like everybody in the room is looking at me like I'm the buzzkill.<br/> I'm not? Good.<br/> Okay.<br/> Great.<br/> Oh, my g! Did you get any of that? It's-a good-a show!   <br/>

I got to tell you, Rick.<br/> It's pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style.<br/> I agree, Morty.<br/> [ Belches .]<br/> It's nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year.<br/> -Ohh! -Relax.<br/> That's what windshields are for.<br/> I didn't know that there were bugs out in space.<br/> Well, w-what did you think, Morty? Life just developed on earth by itself? Here, let me take care of this.<br/> Geez, Rick, that's disgusting.<br/> I don't want to look at that.<br/> Yeah, guess I'm out of fluid.<br/> L-let me find a place to stop.<br/> Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us? The general store ought to have what you need.<br/> Thanks.<br/> Of course, you'll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown.<br/> Yeah, sure thing.<br/> Wait a minute.<br/> What? Why? Sundown is when the festival begins.<br/> The festival? Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, -living in perfect peace.<br/> -Oh, I know what this is! You've been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence.<br/> -That's right.<br/> -What?! It's like ""the purge,"" Morty.<br/> That movie ""the purge""? Oh, have you been here before? No, no, but I've been to a few planets with the same gimmick.<br/> You know, sometimes it's called the cleansing or the red time.<br/> There was this one world that called it just murder night.<br/> I-it's a purge planet.<br/> They're peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge.<br/> T-that's horrible! Yeah.<br/> You want to check it out?  [ Electricity crackling .]<br/> So, what do you do during the festival? You lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff? Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff.<br/> Oh, I bet you do, old timer.<br/> [ Laughs .]<br/> Gee-- Rick, come on.<br/> The sun is setting.<br/> W-we got to get out of here.<br/> All right, well, w-what do I owe you for the wiper fluid? It's on the house.<br/> Oh, and, uh, why -- why don't you have some candy bars, as well? Oh, no way.<br/> That's really nice of you.<br/> I'm a nice guy For now.<br/> [ Chuckling .]<br/> Ohh, I don't doubt it.<br/> -Rick! -Yeah, yeah.<br/> Hey, have a good festival, old timer.<br/> I intend to.<br/> Rick, unlock it! Just a second, Morty.<br/> Oh, look at that sunset.<br/> Stop screwing around.<br/> [ Click .]<br/> There we go.<br/> Much better.<br/> Now we can see.<br/> Great.<br/> Hey, you know what, Morty? Why don't we christen our squeaky-clean windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it? What?! No! What is your problem?! Morty, grow up.<br/> If you don't want to watch, don't watch, but, you know, it's my car.<br/> [ Belches .]<br/> Also, if you tell your mom about this, -I'll purge you.<br/> -You're the worst.<br/> And this planet is the worst.<br/> How can you be into this? You know, people are gonna kill each other.<br/> So, what, y-y-you trying to sit here and tell me that [belches.]<br/> I-if -- if there's a video online with someone getting decapitated, -you don't click on it? -No! Why -- why would I do that? You do that? I don't, because it would bore me.<br/> I see [Bleep.]<br/> like that for breakfast, Morty.<br/> But if you don't do it, I say it's because you're afraid of your own primal instincts.<br/> So you stuff them down and -- [ Bell chiming .]<br/> Oh, oh! Shh.<br/> Shh.<br/> It's starting.<br/> -Oh-ho-ho! Here we go.<br/> -I'm not watching.<br/> Yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal's in the mail.<br/> -I'm gonna get a closer look.<br/> -Oh, okay, sure.<br/> And then someone's gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we're gonna crash and we're gonna be stuck down there and it's gonna be what we deserve.<br/> Yawn.<br/> Whoa! [ Indistinct shouting .]<br/> Whoa, they are purging the [Bleep.]<br/> out of each other.<br/> [ Muffled screaming .]<br/> Oh, my God! Oh [Bleep.]<br/> That was -- okay, yeah.<br/> T-that was gross.<br/> Wow.<br/> Man, I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this one, Morty.<br/> Ugh.<br/> My appetite for purge-spectating got filled pretty quick.<br/> Oh, God.<br/> [ Grunts .]<br/> [ Retching .]<br/> [ Woman screaming .]<br/> Get away from me! No! No! Help! Somebody help me! Aah! All right, Morty.<br/> L-let's get out of here.<br/> Wait, wait, wait.<br/> Hold on.<br/> W-we have to go down there.<br/> [ Belching .]<br/> What? Why? That poor girl.<br/> W-we have to save her.<br/> Uh, Morty, in space, we have something we call the non-interference policy.<br/> We got the wiper fluid.<br/> We watched them kill each other.<br/> We're leaving.<br/> Help me save that girl, or I'm telling mom you brought me here.<br/> You little turd.<br/> [ Screaming .]<br/> Please! Leave me alone! Leave you alone? During a purge? I don't think so, baby.<br/> It's okay.<br/> We're not gonna hurt you.<br/> My name is Morty.<br/> This is my grandpa.<br/> -We're tourists.<br/> -Not anymore.<br/> -Aah! -Aah! Oh, my God.<br/> This is [Bleep.]<br/> awesome! Morty, this is really cool.<br/> Hey, y-you want to help me out here and kill some people? It's fun.<br/> We're totally justified because we're saving a little girl.<br/> I mean, w-w-we're both free and clear to murder these people.<br/> -Are you okay? -Yes.<br/> I have to find somewhere to hide.<br/> Well, you can hide with us.<br/> Rick? -Yeah? -Do you think we could take -- -w-what's your name? -Arthrisha.<br/> Could we take arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge? Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you've done to blackmail me? Your vehicle -- is it from the gods? -No.<br/> -Yes.<br/> So, uh, you know, when the purge started, did people get into it right away, or were they like, ""wait, what? This is gonna stop crime how, exactly?"" Yeah, it took some time for people to accept it.<br/> Yeah, I bet.<br/> [ Chuckles .]<br/> I bet.<br/> Yeah, it's kind of like cellphones, you know? At first, everyone was like, ""look at those douchebags purging,"" and then the next thing you know, they're like, ""it's just so convenient.<br/>"" Geez, you working on your tight five for the comedy store, Morty? Whatcha doing? Watching some TV, playing on your phone? -Is that a real question? -Just making conversation.<br/> Are you? What part of that gives me anything to work with? My choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic, or bark ""yes"" like a trained animal.<br/> It's not a conversation.<br/> You're holding me verbally hostage.<br/> Okay, ass-face.<br/> I'll go in the kitchen.<br/> -Hey, dad.<br/> -Yeah? Whatcha doing? Going into the kitchen? Okay.<br/> -Yeah, you like that? -Screw you.<br/> So, uh, do most people wear masks when they purge? I-I don't want to answer any more purge questions.<br/> All right, hey, hey, that's cool.<br/> I can roll with that.<br/> [ Blowing raspberries .]<br/> -[ Gasps .]<br/> My Nana! -Huh? My Nana! We have to save her! You just now remembered your Nana exists.<br/> I-I was traumatized.<br/> Haven't you been through like 15 purges? I mean, some as a child? Will somebody just help me get her? Fine, whatever.<br/> Morty, stay.<br/> Oh, God.<br/> Oh, crap.<br/> Oh, crap! -Get out! Get out! -Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Get the [Bleep.]<br/> out of the flying machine! Oh, my God! O-okay! Okay! -Back up, asshole.<br/> -[ Whimpers .]<br/> -Back up.<br/> -Ohh.<br/> -Back the [Bleep.]<br/> up! -Aah! For what it's worth, I'm sorry, but that's not really worth anything tonight, is it? Y-you can't leave us here.<br/> You're killing us! You hear me? Come back.<br/> Y-you got to come back.<br/> Change your mind.<br/> Oh, geez.<br/> Morty! Aah! [Bleep.]<br/> Amish bitch shot me! [ Grunts .]<br/> She tried to purge me, Morty.<br/> You let your wiener do the walking, and now I'm dead.<br/> -Rick, she took the car! -You [Bleep.]<br/> kidding me, Morty?! She took my car and the gun.<br/> We're like the rest of these assholes now.<br/> W-w-we're gonna get purged, Morty.<br/> Help me up.<br/> Oh, geez, geez! Wait a minute, Rick.<br/> Why don't we just use your portal gun? It's in the car, dip-ass.<br/> [ Grunts .]<br/> Oh, God, it hurts.<br/> She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty.<br/> It's the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, Morty, and now it has a hole in it.<br/> I hope it was worth it.<br/> I was just trying to do right.<br/> Yeah, well, that's not really the theme of tonight's party.<br/> Heads up.<br/> Rapists.<br/> Well, don't just stand there, Morty.<br/> -Purge 'em.<br/> -Me? No, me.<br/> Should I rub my liver hole on them? Pick up a stick or something and kill them.<br/> -Um, w-we come in peace.<br/> -[ Screaming .]<br/> Oh, my God.<br/> [ Grunts .]<br/> There's more where that came from! You want to get purged, you bring it! Drop [Belches.]<br/> drop your shit! Drop it all.<br/> Morty, go get their shit.<br/> Hurry up.<br/> I only had one of those things I threw.<br/> I'm holding a box of tic tacs right now.<br/> -Want some crackers? -No, thank you.<br/> Are you ready to be nice to me? In exchange for crackers? -What happened to you? -Dad, get a job.<br/> You're trying to create drama because you're bored.<br/> Oh.<br/> [ Beeping, whirring .]<br/> It's the space phone grandpa gave us.<br/> -Hello? -Hey, Summer, it's grandpa.<br/> I need you to do me a favor.<br/> -I can barely hear you.<br/> -Who is it?

All right, okay! Summer, on the shelf above my workbench in the garage, there's a red box with a keypad on it.<br/> You're gonna take that box outside, and you're gonna type the number I just gave you into the keypad.<br/> -Got it? -Got it.<br/> Is it just part of growing up to hate your dad? I'm ignoring you.<br/> Morty, if I can get to the top of that lighthouse, I can send the beacon, and your sister can launch our package.<br/> Just remember, if there's people in there and they try to purge us, we got to purge them first.<br/> We're not purging anyone, Rick, all right? W-will you stop it? Morty, if we're gonna survive tonight, you're gonna need to harness your repressed rage.<br/> I don't have any! Spoken like a person with repressed rage.<br/> [ Doorbell rings .]<br/> I take no part in the festival.<br/> If you desire to kill me, I only ask you do it quickly.<br/> No such agenda, chief.<br/> We're not too keen on the purge, either, sir.<br/> We were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse so we can send a beacon to my sister on earth.<br/> -It's a different planet.<br/> -By the way, life on other planets exists.<br/> Don't let it distract you.<br/> I'll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and beacon-sending on the condition that you listen to my tale.<br/> -Okay.<br/> -Deal.<br/> All right, I'm gonna go to the roof and set things up.<br/> -Morty, you listen to his tale.<br/> -Okay.<br/> [ Clears throat .]<br/> ""Fade in.<br/> Exterior.<br/> Unnamed city.<br/> Day.<br/> The hustle and bustle is a symphony of progress.<br/> We pan past windows, each of which contain a different story, to find jacey lakims, 28 -- hot, but doesn't know it.<br/> Jacey stops when her high heel gets caught in the grating of a sewer.<br/> Suddenly, a man steps into frame and points a gun at her.<br/> This is not her day.<br/> Fade to black.<br/> Title -- 'three weeks earlier.<br/>'"" [ sighs .]<br/> You really don't want to talk to me about this.<br/> Dad, grandpa and Morty are in danger.<br/> You're unemployed, and you're bored.<br/> -They're a higher priority.<br/> -Stop saying I'm unemployed!

This is really amazing.<br/>  it feels good yeah, but -- ah, all right.<br/> [Bleep.]<br/> It.<br/>  It feels good yeah, bitch, what's up?  It feels good  it feels good  yeah  it feels good whoa!

""Feels good.<br/>"" It's a [Bleep.]<br/> hit song.<br/>  it feels good topped the charts, I think.<br/> Ho, ho!  Oh, it feels good [ rooster crows .]<br/> Hey, thanks for helping me, Rick.<br/> You're a pretty great guy.<br/> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br/> [Bleep.]<br/> You for shooting my liver.<br/> I'll see you around.<br/> Oh, man.<br/> What -- what happened? Don't worry about it, Morty.<br/> Listen, if you wanted to try to get a piece, you better hurry up.<br/> Now's your last chance.<br/> Hey, hey, arthrisha, um, maybe I could -- uh, I have a boyfriend.<br/> -Okay.<br/> -I'm not trying to be rude.<br/> I just -- I don't want to lead you on.<br/> I-I-I understand.<br/> I mean, thank you so much for helping end the festival, but I have a boyfriend, and, uh, he's just -- okay, okay, you can stop saying it.<br/> I took it okay the first time, and now you're just repeating stuff.<br/> -Oh, I'm sorry.<br/> -It's okay.<br/> Oh, you're so sweet, I just -- oh, but I can't.<br/> Yeah, you're still doing it.<br/> It won't be easy creating a new society from the ground up.<br/> Well, a helpful rule might be if you need something, you get it.<br/> -Pretty simple, right? -I need food.<br/> -Who's got food for that guy? -I do, but this is for me.<br/> Can't you make some more? Oh, sure.<br/> And while I'm making food for everyone, who takes care of my kids? I'll take care of your kids, if I get some extra food for it.<br/> Extra food? Well, I'm not gonna do extra work if we all get the same.<br/> All right, okay, fair is fair.<br/> If you do extra work, you get extra food.<br/> Oh.<br/> [ All murmuring .]<br/> Who's gonna keep track of who gets how much food for how much work? Hello.<br/> I can do that.<br/> I'll keep track of everyone's food, you know, in exchange for food.<br/> That's not a real job! Oh, and making food is? You son of a bitch! Eat this! [ All screaming .]<br/> Guys, guys, guys, guys, whoa, whoa.<br/> Cool it, now.<br/> Take it easy.<br/> There's too much aggression here.<br/> What if we designate a period of time during which we can all get this hate, murder, and rage out of our system -- I can't help but feel ashamed about what I did back there, Rick.<br/> I guess you were right.<br/> I've got a lot of repressed stuff -I need to deal with.<br/> -Don't worry about it, Morty.<br/> Remember those candy bars earlier -that we got in the first act? -Yeah, what about them? Turns out they have a chemical in them called purgenol that amplifies all your violent tendencies.<br/> Oh, boy.<br/> Whew! Thank goodness for that, huh? That's a relief.<br/> Yep.<br/> Don't even sweat.<br/> You're still the same old Morty.<br/> Your character's totally protected.<br/>  It feels good  Man: And there's the approach.<br/> Jerry, what is ""taddi Mason llc,"" and why is our phone bill $700? Uh Hey, are you bored Uh Lonely, just looking for a friend? Uh Call me, taddi Mason.<br/> It's only $1.<br/>99 a minute to talk.<br/> Uh Sign up today, and I'll even call you on a regular basis Uh For just $1.<br/>99 a minute.<br/> That's a steal because I'm a great pal.<br/> Uh We could talk about sports or barbecue.<br/> [ Grunts .]<br/> Jerry, get a job.<br/> <br/>

                    			1
 Rick: Anyway, that's how I
 escaped from space prison!
  Oh, scary place.<br/>
  Wow, Rick! That's -- That's
 one -- one heck of a story.<br/>
  I sure do wish I could have been
 there to see it happen.<br/>
 Oh, come on.<br/>
  Who wants to watch
 a mad scientist use
 handmade sci-fi tools
  to take out highly trained
 alien guards
  when we can sit here
 and be a family at Shoney's?
  Dad, it's great to have you
 back, no matter where we are,
  but wouldn't you like
 to go home?
  Emotionally speaking, honey,
 Shoney's is my home.<br/>
  Yeah, but you just
 got out of prison.<br/>
  I mean, how much of a step up
 from that is --
  Jerry, get out of the booth,
 take all your clothes off,
  and fold yourself
 12 times.<br/>
  You got it.<br/>
  [ Grunting .]<br/>
  Six folds, huh?
  W-W-What, have you guys got me
 in a Series 9000?
  You cheap insect [bleep.]<br/>
 didn't think I was worth
 your best equipment?
  [ Chuckles .]<br/>
 Man, I told the money bugs.<br/>
  I said, ""You know
 who this guy is, right?
  You want me to get intel
 out of the smartest mammal
  in the galaxy, you better
 give me a decent brainalyzer.<br/>""
  Well, you might as well
 order some pancakes,
  because I don't see the need
 to leave this part of my brain.<br/>
  Oh, I think you do.<br/>
  Eventually, you're either gonna
 relax your cerebellum
  Shoney's.<br/>
 or the Series 9000
 is going to turn it into mush.<br/>
  [ Farts .]<br/>
 Relaxed enough?
 [ Chuckles .]<br/>
  I admire you, Rick.<br/>
 [ Farts .]<br/>
  [ Laughs .]<br/>
  When I --
 [ Farts .]<br/>
  [ Laughs .]<br/>
  Rick, here's --
 [ Farts .]<br/>
  [ Laughs .]<br/>
  What's going on?
  It's hard to tell.<br/> He may have
 manifested some sort of butt.<br/>
  He can do that?
  He is the smartest man
 in the universe.<br/>
    [ Sighs .]<br/>
  I tell ya, the
 Galactic Federation
 taking over Earth --
  best thing that's ever happened
 to this family.<br/>
  I just got my sixth promotion
 this week,
  and I still don't know
 what I do.<br/>
  Who cares how high
 they promote you?
  Everyone just gets paid
 in pills.<br/>
  Well, when you're not sure
 what you do for a living,
  youcan make your own rules.<br/>
  Summer, show your father
 some respect.<br/>
  He's pulling down
 a six-chewable figure income.<br/>
  [ Bottle shatters .]<br/>
  I'll get that in a moment.<br/>
 How are everyone's pills?
  Oh, Morty, you've hardly
 touched your pills.<br/>
  I kind of had big pills
 for lunch, and I
  [muffled.]<br/> wasn't gonna eat
 any more pills.<br/>
  [ Gulps .]<br/>
  Thank you, Conroy.<br/>
  You spoil us,
 Conroy.<br/>
  Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up
 with this!
  Stop saying his name!
 He abandoned us.<br/>
  Willem Dafoe!
  Th-That's the guy I couldn't
 think of this morning.<br/>
  Don't make
 my mistake, Summer.<br/>
  Don't deify the people
 that leave you.<br/>
  You'll end up a horse surgeon
 in a world controlled by aliens
  whose medicine
 keeps horses
  [sobs.]<br/>
 healthy forever.<br/>
  [ Sniffles .]<br/> Horses live longer
 than tortoises now.<br/>
  Is that what you want
 for yourself?
  Maybe I just want you to care
 if I run away yelling!
  Who saved room
 for pill brÃ»lÃ©e?
  Ooh!
 [ Chuckles .]<br/>
  I can see why you chose
 this family-friendly restaurant
  to represent
 your cerebellum.<br/>
  So safe, so comfortable,
 so Shoney's.<br/>
  But admit it, Rick -- you're
 going crazy cooped up in here.<br/>
  Let's go visit
 some memories.<br/>
  Oh,
 any particular ones?
  You want to see
 my first boner,
  or should we go straight
 to the moment
  I discovered
 interdimensional travel?
  [ Squeals .]<br/>
 Ooh, your little flappy doodles
 are twitching.<br/>
  Does that mean you're aroused,
 or did you just get a signal
  that one of your buddies
 found a grape?
  It's arousal.<br/>
  Yes, I'd like very much
 to visit the memory
  of you inventing
 your portal gun.<br/>
  Yeah, well, tough titties.<br/>
 [ Rumbling .]<br/>
  There's no tougher titty
 than a psychotic break, Rick.<br/>
  Well, that depends on who breaks
 first -- me or the titty.<br/>
  Someone special
 you remember?
  Is that your memory of her
 out there --
  between where you were
 on 9/11
  and your favorite
 sports blooper?
  [ Whooshing .]<br/>
  If we stay here, you'll die,
 along with all your memories.<br/>
  If you take me
 where I want to go
  she'll be there, too,
 won't she?
  The day I invented the portal
 gun is the day I lost her.<br/>
  Oh,
 that sounds cool.<br/>
  I can get what I want
 and you can say goodbye.<br/>
  [ Sighs .]<br/>
 Fine, but I'm driving.<br/>
  as an excuse
 to strip away our freedom.<br/>
  Huh? What are you --
 What are you doing?
  Grandpa Rick must have
 some secret lab, right?
  With, like, laser guns and
 jets packs and a space tank!
  And we can go
 break him out of prison!
  Look at these dead flies!
  Maybe if we arrange them
 in a certain order,
  it plays a hologram
 or it opens a secret door.<br/>
  Summer,
 you're freaking me out.<br/>
  I know things have changed
 a lot, and I know you miss Rick,
  but getting him back
 wouldn't make things better.<br/>
  And, you know,
 we're not doing so bad.<br/>
  We're miserable, Morty!
  There's a mandatory curfew,
 their weird calendar made me 47,
  and they weaponized
 the Eiffel Tower!
  Hey, I like being 35.<br/>
 I-I can rent a car now.<br/>
  Because you suck.<br/>
  You've been keeping
 your lip zipped about it
  since Grandpa got arrested,
 but the fact is,
  you're freaking stoked
 to bail on him.<br/>
  He bails on everybody!
  He bailed on Mom
 when she was a kid!
  He -- He bailed
 on tiny planet!
  And in case I never made this
 clear to you, Summer,
  he bailed on you.<br/>
  He left you to rot
 in a world that he ruined
  because he doesn't care!
  Because nobody's special to him,
 Summer,
  not even himself.<br/>
  So, if you really want your
 grandpa back, grab a shovel.<br/>
  The one that won't let you down
 is buried in your backyard!
  You're right!
  What?!
 No, I'm not right.<br/>
  I-I was using
 ghoulish overkill!
  Ghoulish overkill,
 Summer!
  [ Summer grunting .]<br/>
  [ Thunder crashes .]<br/>
  Oh, God!
 Oh, God!
  Whoa, whoa!
  [ Thunder crashes .]<br/>
  Where are we going?
  To the day it all began
 and ended.<br/>
  The moment
 that changed everything.<br/>
  Welcome to McDonald's.<br/>
 Can I take your order?
  Yeah, I'd like to get
 a 10-piece McNugget
  and a bunch
 of the Szechuan sauce.<br/>
  Like, as much as you're allowed
 to give me.<br/>
  In 1998, they had this promotion
 for the Disney film ""Mulan,""
  where they --
 where they --
  they created a new sauce
 for the McNuggets
  called Szechuan sauce,
 and it's delicious!
  And then they got rid of it,
 and now it's gone.<br/>
  This is the only place
 we're gonna be able to
 try it, is in my memory.<br/>
  Rick, you're doing this bit
 while your brain is melting.<br/>
  Okay.<br/> All right,
 all right.<br/>
  Is that
 Me.<br/>
  I used to wear
 blue pants.<br/>
  When'd you make the leap
 to interdimensional travel?
  I didn't.<br/>
 Idid.<br/>
  Well, well, well.<br/>
  If it isn't us.<br/>
  You know the worst part
 about inventing teleportation?
  Suddenly, you're able to travel
 the whole galaxy,
  and the first thing
 you learn is,
  you're the last guy
 to invent teleportation.<br/>
  Fortunately, you're about
 to invent something
 much more powerful.<br/>
  [ Squeals .]<br/>
  What?
  [ Thunder crashes .]<br/>
  Summer, nobody has to know
 about that.<br/>
  We could put it right back
 and pretend we never saw it,
  like we did
 with Dad's mannequin leg.<br/>
  Fine, stay here.<br/>
 I'll rescue Grandpa myself.<br/>
  And how are you gonna
 do that?
 I don't know yet.<br/>
  I'll make it up
 as I go.<br/>
  That's what
 Grandpa Rick does.<br/>
  That's what heroes do.<br/>
  Y-You want to see
 what a hero Rick is?
  I-I'll bring you somewhere,
 Summer.<br/>
  Um
 My goodness, children.<br/>
  [ Sternly .]<br/> Relinquish
 the illegal technology
  to the nearest
 Federation representative.<br/>
  [ Normal voice .]<br/> And then
 we'll all play Balderdash.<br/>
  [ Both whimper, scream .]<br/>
  [ Screaming .]<br/>
  [ Farting .]<br/>
    [ Grunts .]<br/> Oh, my goodness!
 Oh, oh! My goo--
  [ Crackling .]<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/>
  I have
 that exact same top.<br/>
  What is this place?
  And what's with
 ""Hunger Games"" Summer?
  That's my sister.<br/>
 This used to be my home.<br/>
  Imagine doing
 anything you want,
  then hopping to a timeline
 where you never did it.<br/>
  Imagine going anywhere,
 anytime,
  with nobody able
 to stop you.<br/>
  Sounds lonely.<br/>
  Lonely? Dude,
 you have yourself --
  your infinite selves.<br/>
  It's a nonstop party
 where all the guests
  are the only person
 we like.<br/>
  You think it's cool
 being the smartest man on Earth,
  but once we give you
 this technology,
  you become the smartest thing
 in every conceivable universe --
  the Infinite Rick,
 a god.<br/>
  Eh, pass.<br/>
  Excuse me?
 Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.<br/>
  Who do you think
 you are?
  A different kind of Rick,
 I guess.<br/>
  Well, we'll see how long
 that lasts.<br/>
  I heard
 sci-fi noises.<br/>
  Did you make
 a breakthrough?
  Sort of.<br/>
  I just took
 a long look at myself,
  and I don't think this
 science thing is gonna pay off.<br/>
  Well, why don't I get Beth
 and we'll go out for ice cream?
  That, Dianne,
 is the last great idea
  that will ever be had
 in this garage.<br/>
  [ Munching loudly .]<br/>
  Good roasted Cronenberg,
 I assume.<br/>
  Mom, you're looking
 feral.<br/>
  I can't believe
 Rick did this.<br/>
  These are the parts
 of Rick's adventures
  you don't get to see --
 the parts he leaves behind.<br/>
  All right,
 it's been great, guys.<br/>
  I really only wanted to stop by
 here for a quick ""I told ya so.<br/>""
  So, uh
 Looking for this?
  What are you doing
 with that?!
  It stinks of Rick.<br/>
 [ Grunts .]<br/>
  No! Why?!
 Why would you do that?!
  W-W-What is the matter
 with you people?!
  You can never leave.<br/>
 She cannot remain.<br/>
  She stinks of Rick.<br/>
  [ All scream .]<br/>
  Hold your fire!
 Hold your fire!
  I'm Morty C-137.<br/>
  We detected a compromised
 portal gun.<br/> Where is your Rick?
  He's in prison.<br/>
 Summer.<br/>
  He got captured
 by the Federation
  and we were going to
 rescue him.<br/>
  Very troubling.<br/>
 We can't risk Citadel secrets
  falling into
 the Federation's hands.<br/>
  We'll dispatch S.<br/>E.<br/>A.<br/>L.<br/>
 Team Ricks immediately
  to break into the prison
 holding C-137.<br/>
  Boo-yah.<br/>
 And assassinate him.<br/>
  Boo-nah?
  [ Horn honks .]<br/>
 Come on, girls!
 The ice cream's gonna melt.<br/>
  [ Munching .]<br/>
  [ Whooshing .]<br/>
  [ Beeping .]<br/>
  Nooooooo!
  Wow.<br/>
 This sauce is [bleep.]<br/> amazing.<br/>
  You said it was promoting
 a movie?
  [ Slurping .]<br/>
  Carry the three,
 add a two.<br/>
  I got it.<br/>
 I [bleep.]<br/> got it.<br/>
  Whoa.<br/>
 I-Is that it, the portal gun?
  Yeah.<br/>
 That's the three lines of math
  that separates my life
 as a man from my life
 as an unfeeling ghost.<br/>
  Awesome-possum.<br/>
  [ Whirring .]<br/>
  Mission Control,
 you getting this?
  Holy shit, yes!
 Yes, we got it! Yeah!
  Thanks, Rick.<br/> I'll try
 to remember to shut
 off the brainalyzer.<br/>
  Actually, I think
 it shuts off automatically
  once your brain
 is liquid.<br/>
  Don't know,
 don't care.<br/>
  Pull me out.<br/>
  Hey, pull me out.<br/>
 Can you hear me?
  Nope, they cannot.<br/>
 Why not?
  Because the code you just
 uploaded wasn't actually
 my portal-gun formula,
  it was a virus giving me full
 control over the brainalyzer.<br/>
  What are you talking about?
 This is a memory.<br/>
  Y-You can't alter details
 of a memory.<br/>
  True, but you can alter
 anything you want
  about a totally fabricated
 origin story.<br/>
  It's a trap! Abort!
 I'm still in his Shoney's!
  Repeat -- we never left
 his Shoney's!
  Mission accomplished, boys.<br/>
 Pull me out.<br/>
  Roger that.<br/>
  Okay, have fun in what's left
 of my brain.<br/>
  I'm gonna transfer
 to yours.<br/>
  Oh, there's not enough room
 for all my genius,
  so I'm leaving you with
 my fear of wicker furniture,
  my desire
 to play the trumpet,
  my tentative plans
 to purchase a hat,
  and six years
 of improv workshops.<br/>
  Comedy comes in threes.<br/>
  It's a trap! Abort!
 We never left his --
  [ Farts .]<br/>
 [ Laughs .]<br/>
  No!
  Another day,
 another dollar.<br/>
  Am I great insect creature
 or what?!
  Congratulations, Agent.<br/>
  You'll be highly commended
 for this.<br/>
  Always wait for permission
 to [burps.]<br/> feel accomplishment.<br/>
  That's my motto.<br/>
 One thing
 still perplexes me --
  why would Rick Sanchez
 turn himself in?
  Well, I'm just a dumb-ass bug,
 but it's possible Rick knew
  he'd be interrogated
 at this facility,
  where we not only keep
 our most wanted,
  but our
 most sensitive data.<br/>
  Anyone here with level-nine
 access could [burps.]<br/>
  I don't know,
 collapse a government.<br/>
  I'm just gonna go
 take a dump.<br/>
  Is it cool if I use
 the level-nine bathroom?
  W-W-What's the level-nine
 master access code again?
  Oh, that's easy --
 8-3
  Yeah!
  S.<br/>E.<br/>A.<br/>L.<br/> Team Ricks
 in the house!
  [ Screaming .]<br/>
  Hi, Rick.<br/>
  Bye, Rick.<br/>
  D-99, y-you okay?
  [ Grunting .]<br/>
  I'm bummed I didn't get to give
 that insect dick a test-drive.<br/>
  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
 T-The Council of Ricks sent us.<br/>
  We have
 your Morty and Summer.<br/>
  They're prisoners
 on the Citadel.<br/>
  Great!
 [ Grunts .]<br/>
  Security breach in room 6755.<br/>
  Lovely.<br/> Not only
 is my plan screwed up,
  I also forgot
 how to improvise.<br/>
  All security people approach.<br/>
 [ Grunts .]<br/>
  Security breach.<br/>
  A city of Grandpas?
  Morty:
 It's the Citadel of Ricks.<br/>
  All the different Ricks
 from all the different realities
  got together to hide here
 from the government.<br/>
  But if every Rick
 hates the government,
  why would they
 hate Grandpa?
  Because Ricks hate themselves
 the most.<br/>
  And our Rick
 is the mosthimself.<br/>
  Not anymore, homey.<br/>
  S.<br/>E.<br/>A.<br/>L.<br/> Team Ricks
 turned his unibrow
  into two brows --
 with a bullet.<br/>
  [ Laughter .]<br/>
  Your Rick's dead!
 Your Rick's dead!
    Sir, Rick D-99 is returning
 from the mission alone.<br/>
  Apparently, S.<br/>E.<br/>A.<br/>L.<br/> Team Ricks
 suffered heavy casualties.<br/>
  Bring him in.<br/>
  He says he'll only talk to
 a Rick with higher clearance.<br/>
  La-di-da.<br/>
 Give me that.<br/>
  D-99, this is the commander in
 chief of the Citadel's militia.<br/>
  Go[burps.]<br/> --
 good enough.<br/>
  He's a spy.<br/> Blow him up.<br/>
 I'm gonna go take a shit.<br/>
  Operating
 an unregistered portal gun,
  radicalizing a Summer,
  conspiring with
 a traitorous Rick.<br/>
  How do you plead?
  How is this
 a fair trial?
  O-Our lawyer
 is a Morty.<br/>
  It's not fair, you have no
 rights, and he's not a lawyer.<br/>
  We just keep him here
 because he's fun.<br/>
  Look at him go.<br/>
  [ Laughs .]<br/>
 Ha ha, yeah!
  We'll be lenient
 if you renounce your Rick.<br/>
  What say you, Summer?
  I say [bleep.]<br/> you!
  My grandpa was my hero.<br/>
  You killed him
 because you were jealous of him.<br/>
  That's pretty obvious
 from the haircuts.<br/>
  So do what you want to me,
 but let my brother go.<br/>
  He already
 renounced Rick.<br/>
  Morty?
  [ Whispers indistinctly .]<br/>
 What?
  N-No, I don't want to see
 your Pog collection.<br/>
  I don't renounce Rick,
 and I never have.<br/>
  I was just trying
 to protect my sister.<br/>
  I wanted you to have
 a normal life.<br/>
  That's something you can't have
 when Rick shows up.<br/>
  Everything real turns fake.<br/>
 Everything right is wrong.<br/>
  All you know is that you know
 nothing and he knows everything.<br/>
  And, well -- well,
 he's not a villain, Summer,
  but he shouldn't be
 your hero.<br/>
  He's more like a demon
 or a super [bleep.]<br/>up god.<br/>
  Let's not suck the ghost
 of his [bleep.]<br/> too hard.<br/>
  He was a terrorist,
 and now he's dead.<br/>
  Oh, yeah? If you think
 my Rick's dead, he's alive.<br/>
  And if you think you're safe,
 he's coming for you!
  [ All grumbling .]<br/>
  [ Whistling .]<br/>
  Hey, whoa, whoa!
 What are you doing in here?
  This area's for teleporting
 the entire Citadel
  to somewhere else
 using only buttons and dials.<br/>
  Yeah, well,
 it's a bad idea
  to have it designed
 that way then, isn't it?
  [ Whirring .]<br/>
  [ Screaming .]<br/>
 What the [bleep.]<br/>
  We just teleported into
 a galactic federal prison.<br/>
  I'm gonna go take a shit.<br/>
 [ Alarm blaring .]<br/>
  Lawyer Morty:
 Order in the court!
  Whoa! What the hell?!
 Oh, my God!
  [ Screaming .]<br/>
  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
 No, no, no!
  Whoa!
 [ Screaming .]<br/>
  Whoa!
  The Citadel's been teleported
 to [burps.]<br/> Federation space.<br/>
  It's doomed.<br/>
 This has to be C-137, you guys.<br/>
  What are we gonna do?!
 You know he's coming for us.<br/>
  All right, calm down!
 We have his Summer as a hostage.<br/>
  Obviously, I get her.<br/>
  You guys play Rick, Laser,
 Scissors for the Morty.<br/>
  W-W-What the hell
 is that?
  Payback.<br/>
  [ Screaming .]<br/>
  Grandpa Rick!
  Duh!
 You're alive!
  Rick!
 Morty, take this.<br/>
 You're gonna need it later.<br/>
    Hold on, hold on.<br/>
 Whoa!
  Council Member:
 That's enough, Rick.<br/>
  What -- What's this
 supposed to accomplish?
  We have infinite
 grandkids.<br/>
  You're trying to use
 Disney bucks at a
 Caesar's Palace here.<br/>
  That's a bluff.<br/>
 He's bluffing, sir.<br/> He loves me.<br/>
  You're a rogue Rick --
 irrational, passionate.<br/>
  You love your grandkids.<br/>
 You came to rescue them.<br/>
  I came to kill you,
 bro.<br/>
  That's not even
 my original Summer.<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/> He's not bluffing.<br/>
 He's not bluffing!
  R-Rick?
 Why not shoot through her?
  20 yards, nine-gauge
 plasma pistol,
  My first shot would liquify
 her insides and injure you,
  second shot adds recoil.<br/>
  The risk to me is minimized
 if I wait for you to shoot her,
  which I'm encouraging you
 to do.<br/>
  What the [bleep.]<br/>
 Or let her go,
  which I will reward
 with a quicker death.<br/>
  Because you love her!
  Because it's incentive for you
 to give me my cleanest shot,
  which will be your
 least painful death.<br/>
  But if you want to die slower
 than that, I'm super into it.<br/>
  All you got to do to get
 that started is kill the girl.<br/>
  I hate you!
 Not an issue, sweetie.<br/>
  That's enough!
 Drop the gun, Rick!
  Morty, I know you're too stupid
 to get this,
  but you're really [bleep.]<br/>
 this up right now.<br/>
  I'm not letting you
 let my sister die!
 Drop the gun!
  I wasn't gonna let her die,
 you [bleep.]<br/> moron!
  Ha!
 Aww.<br/>
  The point is hethought
 I was going to.<br/>
  I totally did,
 by the way.<br/>
  You're a [bleep.]<br/>
 moron, Morty.<br/>
  Morty,
 you [bleep.]<br/> idiot!
  You're a serious
 [bleep.]<br/> idiot, Morty!
  You basically
 killed us all!
  You're the worst!
 You're as dumb as
 a bag of sand.<br/>
  [ All yelling .]<br/>
  [ Screaming .]<br/>
  Who's stupid now,
 bitch?!
  Morty,
 we just got him back!
  [ Laughs .]<br/>
  That was amazing,
 Morty.<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
  Okay, let's wrap this
  Good job, Morty.<br/>
 Let's go, kids.<br/>
  What?!
 What happened?
  Oldest Rick trick
 in the book.<br/>
  ""Fake gun,
 shoot me in standoff.<br/>""
  Brilliant.<br/>
 Ha, yeah.<br/>
  G-Good thing
 I saw that note.<br/>
    Can't we just
 portal home?
  Not until I finish
 what I started.<br/>
  And that is how you get
 level-nine access
  without a password.<br/>
  Freeze!
  Employee of the month,
 ladies and gentlemen.<br/>
  So, what are you doing
 with level-nine access anyways?
  Destroying the [burps.]<br/>
 galactic government.<br/>
 Awesome!    Whoa, cool!
  Are you going to set all their
 nukes to target each other?
  Ooh, or -- or reprogram
 their military portals
  to disintegrate
 their entire space fleet?
  Good pitches, kids.<br/>
 I'm almost proud.<br/>
  But watch closely as Grandpa
 topples an empire
  by changing a one
 to a zero.<br/>
  Mr.<br/> President, the Blemflarck's
 value just dropped to nothing.<br/>
  What do you mean?
 I mean, our single centralized
 galactic currency
  just went from being worth one
 of itself to zero of itself.<br/>
  [ Panicked murmuring .]<br/>
 Calm down, people.<br/>
  Deploy the galactic militia
 and declare martial law.<br/>
  Yes, sir.<br/>
  Uh, what should I
 pay them with?
  Their payment is the honor
 they'll feel to serve their --
  Wait.<br/> Who's paying me
 to yell at this guy?
  I can answer that --
 for money.<br/>
  I never thought I'd live
 to see this day.<br/>
 [ Panicked murmuring .]<br/>
  Gentlemen, gentlemen,
 gentlemen!
  There's a solution here
 you're not seeing.<br/>
  Give me your jacket!
 Give me those pants!
  [ Indistinct shouting .]<br/>
  [ Indistinct shouting .]<br/>
  Insectoid Employee: There's
 no rich people or poor people!
  I want more jackets!
  He who controls the pants
 controls the galaxy!
  [ Whimpering .]<br/>
  [ Gasps .]<br/>
  [ Whimpering .]<br/>
  No longer will the insects
 have domain over surface world!
  [ Whimpering .]<br/>
  Jerry, what the hell
 is happening?!
  The galactic government
 collapsed.<br/>
  Are you okay?
  Look, I-I'm not proud to share
 this, but the truth is,
  I just kept crawling,
 and it kept working.<br/>
  [ Gasps .]<br/>
 Oh, I'm glad
 you're okay.<br/>
  Are we ever going to stop paying
 for indulging your father?
  Our children, our planet,
 our jobs?
  Is there anything left
 to lose?
  Just each other,
 and I'll never let you go.<br/>
  And I'm so sorry
 I ever did this to us.<br/>
  Guess who dismantled
 the government?
  Please don't
 leave me again.<br/>
 I never will, baby.<br/>
  I was right.<br/>
 He turned himself in on purpose.<br/>
  It was all part
 of his plan!
  Jerry, is there any
 light beer left?
  It's insane what you miss
 in prison.<br/>
  Umokay.<br/>
 No.<br/>
  No, no, no.<br/>
 Foot down time.<br/>
  No, you're right.<br/>
 Where's the vodka?
  Beth,
 it's him or me!
  Seems like you guys
 need some privacy.<br/>
  I'll, uh --
 I'll be in the garage.<br/>
  What the [bleep.]<br/>
 Not cool, Jerry!
  A man's garage
 is his castle.<br/>
  [ Beeps .]<br/>
  Jerry's going to
  spend some time
  divorced.<br/>
  Oh, I-I'm sorry
 to hear that, sweetie.<br/>
  I hope I had nothing
 to do with that.<br/>
  Oh, God, Dad, that is not
 your burden to bear.<br/>
  I feel terrible
 that I misjudged you.<br/>
  This is gonna be good
 for Jerry.<br/>
  For everybody.<br/>
 For everybody.<br/>
  [ Text whooshes .]<br/>
  I better tend to Jerry
  before he changes his mind
 and doesn't move out.<br/>
  I will leave you two
 to your adventures.<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/> Nancy says
  they're drawing and quartering
 aliens in the school courtyard,
  and it technically counts
 as patriotism.<br/>
  Geez! Are my parents seriously
 gonna get divorced?
  All right, Rick,
 I'm gonna go to my --
  Not so fast, Morty.<br/>
 You heard your mom.<br/>
  We've got adventures to go on,
 Morty -- just you and me --
  and sometimes your sister
 and sometimes your mom,
  but never your dad.<br/>
  You want to know why, Morty?
 Because he crossed me.<br/>
  Okay, take it easy, Rick.<br/>
 T-T-That's dark.<br/>
  Oh, it gets darker,
 Morty.<br/>
  Welcome to the darkest year
 of our adventures.<br/>
  First thing that's different --
 no more Dad, Morty.<br/>
 Oh, geez.<br/>
  He threatened to turn me in
 to the government,
  so I made him
 and the government go away.<br/>
  Oh [bleep.]<br/>
  I've rep[burps.]<br/>laced them both
 as the de facto patriarch
  of your family
 and your universe.<br/>
  Your mom wouldn't have accepted
 me if I came home
 Oh, man.<br/>
  without you
 and your sister,
  so now you know the real reason
 I rescued you.<br/>
 Oh!
  I just took over the
 family, Morty, and if
 you tell your mom
  Oh, man.<br/>
 or sister I said any of this,
 I'll deny it,
  You're gonna deny it.<br/>
 and they'll take my side
 because I'm a hero, Morty.<br/>
  And now you're gonna
 have to go
 Oh.<br/>
  and do whatever I say,
 Morty, forever!
  And I'll -- I'll go out
 and I'll find some more of that
  ""Mulan"" Szechuan teriyaki
 dipping sauce, Morty.<br/>
  What are you talking about?
 Because that's -- that's
 what this is all about, Morty.<br/>
  Szechuan?
 That's my one-armed man!
  I'm not driven by avenging
 my dead family, Morty!
  That was fake.<br/>
  I-I-I'm driven by finding
 that McNugget sauce.<br/>
  McNuggets?
 I want that ""Mulan""
 McNugget sauce, Morty!
  That's my series arc, Morty.<br/>
 What the hell?
  If it takes
 nine seasons,
  I want my McNugget dipping
 sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.<br/>
 What are you talking about,
 Rick?
  That's what's gonna take us
 all the way to the end, Morty.<br/>
 What are you
 talking about?!
  Season -- Nine more
 seasons, Morty.<br/>
  Nine more seasons until I get
 that dipping Szechuan sauce.<br/>
  What is that?!
 For 97 more years, Morty!
  What are you
 talking about?!
  I want that McNugget sauce,
 Morty!
    Is it ready?
  Yes.<br/>
 We can bring it online now.<br/>
  Do it.<br/>
  I am Phoenix Person.<br/>
  Phoenix Person?
 Is that what we settled on?
  I thought we all agreed
 on Cyber Bird.<br/>
  You said you didn't care
 what he was called
  as long as
 we brought him back.<br/>
  Yeah,
 but Phoenix Person?
  Fine [bleep.]<br/> it.<br/>
 Who cares?
  [ Grunts .]<br/>
  Ka-kaw!

                    			1
 Ohh!
  Summer, next time we're hiding
 in a Colorkian echo nest,
  can you do me a favor
 and turn your ringer off?
  It's called ""carpe diem,""
 Morty.<br/>
  Look it up.<br/>
 - You look it up!
  Y-Y-You don't even You don't
 even know what it means!
  That's because
 losers look stuff up
  while the rest of us
 are carpin' all them diems.<br/>
  Listen to your sister,
 Morty.<br/>
  To live
 is to risk it all.<br/>
  Otherwise,
 you're just an inert chunk
  of randomly
 assembled molecules
  drifting wherever
 the universe blows you.<br/>
  Oh, I'm sorry.<br/>
 Jerry, I didn't see you there.<br/>
  H-How much of that
 did you hear?
  All of it.<br/>
 You were looking right at me.<br/>
  I just wanted
 to say goodbye to the kids.<br/>
  Cool.<br/>
 Just stay in the driveway.<br/>
  The killbots are live, and
 I took you off the white list.<br/>
  W-We'll see you every other
 weekend, though, right?
  Absolutely, Morty.<br/>
  A-And your Mom's lawyer says
  if I can get enough
 in the settlement,
  he can help me
 sue for full custody.<br/>
  Th-That'll be nice.<br/>
  Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving.<br/>
 - Bye, Dad.<br/>
  Rick, didn't you say
 you needed my help
  on an adventure immediately
 somewhere else
  I don't care
 even if it might kill us?
  I did not, but if you're
 really that alienated,
  I'm as willing to exploit it as
 the next guy, church, army,
  or Olympic
 gymnastics trainer.<br/>
  I'm ready when you are.<br/>
  Bitch,
 I was ready yest
  Bye, sweetie.<br/>
  Well, I-I better
  Sure.<br/>
 Sounds important.<br/>
  If you're looking
 for our kids,
  your father did a-a portal,
 uh
  Okay.<br/>
  Wind:
 Loser.<br/>
  What?
  Hello?
    Morty,
 shoot the Mohawk guy!
  - They all have Mohawks!
 - High fade,
  chartreuse with cyan highlights,
 layered on top.<br/>
  Shoot him!
  Ah!
  Light them up.<br/>
  Ahh!
  [.]<br/>, Get in the game, Morty!
  Give me your flask!
  Holy [.]<br/>,
 Summer for the win!
  I [.]<br/>ing love post-apocalyptic
 versions of Earth!
  Here we go!
  Isotope 322.<br/>
  This stuff's
 so powerful, Morty,
  it makes Isotope 465
  look like Isotope 317.<br/>
 - Uh-huh, yeah.<br/>
  Is it powerful enough to keep
 those guys from murdering us?
  Summer!
 - Hold on.<br/>
  I want to try something.<br/>
  Rick, can we not leave
 without my sister?
  Ugh.<br/> You have infinite sisters,
 Morty.<br/>
  I mean, n-not that I want to
 spend the rest of my day
  looking for another one.<br/>
  ""Sum-sum,"" let's go!
  Grandpa's concern for
 your safety is fleeting!
  Your blood
 will be my lotion.<br/>
  Whoa.<br/> That was cool.<br/>
  Kill me, please.<br/>
  Okay, but not because
 you told me to.<br/>
  Summer!
  Okay.<br/> Getting darker.<br/>
  Jesus Christ.<br/>
 Summer!
  Aw, come on.<br/>
  Hands and little
 shoulder-mounted dudes
  where I can see them.<br/>
  I am Hemorrhage.<br/>
  You have removed weak blood
 from us and made us stronger.<br/>
  We can combine our strength
 and feast on the weak together.<br/>
  Wh-Wh-What in the hell
 are you saying?
  They don't have to keep trying
 to kill us if we join them.<br/>
  They're basically pussies.<br/>
 - What is your deal lately?
  All right,
 let's get sloppy.<br/>
  Oh, whoa.<br/>
  Uh, uh, what's, uh
  What's that little bauble
 you got back there?
  Th-Th-That's interesting.<br/>
  That is our glowing rock.<br/>
  We carry it with us
 for desecration,
  to remind us
 there are no gods.<br/>
  Kids, weird pitch
  let's have this be
 our new life.<br/>
  Let's be post-apocalyptic
 scavengers!
  - Okay.<br/>
 - What?
  Grandpa,
 some of the Death Stalkers
  are going to
 what used to be Seattle
  to hunt
 what used to be people.<br/>
  I'm going.<br/>
 - Sounds good.<br/> Stay hydrated.<br/>
  Listen, Rick, Summer's been
 acting pretty crazy lately.<br/>
  You know, I mean, I-I think
 the divorce is affecting her.<br/>
  And, you know,
 I don't think this is
  a great place
 for her to be right now.<br/>
  Oh, get off your high horse,
 Professor Ski Lodge.<br/>
  This world may be
 rough around the edges,
  but it's got its charms.<br/>
  Bicep or quadricep?
  Uh
 bicep.<br/>
  Seriously, Rick?
  Is it really easier
 to eat human flesh
  than to just tell me
 why we're still here?
  No.<br/>
 Okay, I'll level with you.<br/>
  You see
 that green rock, Morty?
  It's about 20 pounds
 of the stuff
  I was getting all hard
 for a flake of.<br/>
  Isotope 322.<br/>
  Well, having
 a 20-pound boulder of it
  is better than
 having a flake.<br/>
  I can explain the math
 to you later, but
  Summer just ran off
 with strangers
  that have ""Death""
 in their name,
  and the rest of their name
 was ""Stalkers.<br/>""
  Huh, could be
 therapeutic for her.<br/>
  She has been acting pretty crazy
 lately, Morty.<br/>
  I mean, her parents are
 going through a divorce
  Damn it, Rick,
 that's what I Fine.<br/>
  Just grab the stupid thing
 while I grab her,
  and let's get the ""F""
 out of ""H.<br/>""
  No, no, no.<br/> Morty, there's
 too much heat on the bogey.<br/>
  I need you
 to distract the camp.<br/>
  ""Distract""?
 They eat each other.<br/>
  What What do you want me to
 do to get their attention,
  put on a puppet show?
  Right idea,
 wrong genre, Morty.<br/>
  The equivalent here
 would be
  Hey, you guys ever use
 that Thunderdome,
  or do you just put it up
 for decoration?
  Uh, you mean
 the Blood Dome?
  Save it for the Semantics Dome,
 E.<br/>B.<br/> White.<br/>
  Ohh, burn!
  The important question is,
  who wants to take a poke
 at my man Spine Eater here?
  I guess I'll see your asses
 in that dome!
  Rick,
 what the hell, man?
  Wh-What are you,
 out of your mind?
  Morty, relax.<br/>
 You're gonna be a ringer.<br/>
  Come here.<br/>
  This device extracts and
 redistributes muscle memory.<br/>
  I'm giving your body a 10-year
 course in wasteland combat
  one limb at a time.<br/>
 - Ow!
  I'm working with
 a mixed bag here,
  so you may not have perfect
 coordination, Morty Ugh!
  Hey!
 - I-I didn't do that!
  Okay, this is exciting.<br/>
  We're making some discoveries
 about muscle memory.<br/>
  Ooh! Help! Help!
  Oh, sweet, man!
  And so it begins,
 my pretties!
  Oh, God! Stop! Stop!
 This is horrible!
  Just stick and move,
 Morty!
  Wear him out!
  How come
 you guys dress like
  you're in a theme-park
 stunt show,
  but these guys wear khakis
 and hockey jerseys?
  After the boom-boom,
 some adapted to the new truth,
  and some chose to huddle
 near the boomy holes,
  clinging to the lie
 of the before-fore times.<br/>
  The raidy-rays
 rotted them away,
  leaving only their love
  for the vert-vert-isements
 on billyboards.<br/>
  Jesus Christ.<br/>
  Did the boomy-booms blow up
 all your wordy-word books?
  I think I was a child
 before the boom-booms.<br/>
  I think
 I looked like this.<br/>
  Want to piss on him?
  Get out of my head.<br/>
  Eli: Ha ha! Whoo!
  Unbelievable!
  A new champ!
  Okay, no more!
  And he wants more!
  No, I don't!
  Someone,
 make this stop!
  Mister, please get out of here,
 or you're gonna die!
  I have nothing
 to do with this!
  Morty.<br/>
  Why would you
 want this to happen?
  All you had to do
 was go away!
  Stop standing in the driveway
 talking about custody!
  And either tell her
 you want to stay married
  or get on with your life,
 but whatever you do,
  stop being a baby
 and act like a man!
  Thank you.<br/>
  Morty,
 that was amazing!
  This is my brother!
  Not that
 family means anything!
  This family does.<br/>
  All right.<br/>
 Good job, champ.<br/>
  Um, can I talk to you kids
 for a second over yonder?
  Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking
 through to something here.<br/>
  C-Can we not leave
 just yet?
  - Leave?
 - I'm not leaving.<br/>
  There is no ""leave.<br/>""
  We are united,
 or we are enemies.<br/>
  Oh, big guy, no.<br/>
  Nobody's leaving.<br/>
  Don't be stupid.<br/>
  We love being united.<br/>
  W love the radiation,
 the trichinosis.<br/>
  We're in it for life,
  which I assume is
 around 20 years, average.<br/>
  I just need a quick aside
 with my grandkids,
  about 40 yards
 from anyone else.<br/>
  Hey,
 the Green Rock is gone!
  - Oh, no!
 - Uh, I know
  why don't we all split up and
 look for it in groups of three?
  Kids?
  Ohh.<br/>
  We'll be right back.<br/>
  Grandpa,
 you're being stupid!
  Just surrender, and our friends
 will give you mercy!
  Kiss my ass, Summer!
  Your friends have no mercy!
 They're lame!
  Death Stalkers,
 bring me his flesh leather!
  Sorry,
 but can we not kill him?
  C-Can we just
 take him prisoner?
  When did I
 lose control here?
  Listen to me
 both of you kids
  need to get out of
 this environment
  so we can properly deal with
 your parents' divorce!
  Alternatively,
 I have a freaking portal gun,
  and I can leave the two of you
 here forever!
  Why does it have to be
 such a dramatic choice?
  Can't we arrange a thing
 where we spend weekends here
  or or visit home
 to do laundry?
  All right, you know what?
  [.]<br/> it!
  My body is chrome!
  My blood is gasoline!
  Nope.<br/> Regular blood.<br/>
  - Dad?
 - Hi, sweetie.<br/>
  - Where are the kids?
 - Oh, ththey aren't with you?
  I thought
 they were with you.<br/>
  Oh, y-you know what?
 Uh, I just remembered.<br/>
  They're out doing something
  completely ordinary
 and kid-related.<br/>
  - Don't panic.<br/>
 - Not panicked at all.<br/> Just
  Oh, God, what's the divorce
 doing to the kids?
  What's it doing to me?
 Did I make a mistake?
  Not a mistake, no!
  I mean, not that
 I have a horse in this race,
  but this divorce decision
 listen mwah!
  good for you,
 good for the kids.<br/>
  I mean, honestly, I think
 that they're flourishing.<br/>
  I mean, you'll see, when
 when when you see them,
  that that they're
 totally flourishing.<br/>
  Booyah!
 [.]<br/> you, pal!
  Who else wants some?
  Who wants to be
 my pussy of a dad today?
  Hey, what's
 what's wrong, man?
  You're not getting weak on me,
 are you?
  What?
  Wait a minute.<br/>
  What's the matter,
 you piece of crap?
  Haven't you ever watched your
 family burn to death before?
  Now I'm gonna whip you.<br/>
 Huh!
  It can't be.<br/>
  It can't be!
  I was just following orders!
 - Whoa, whoa!
  - I was just following orders!
 - Ahh!
  I'll tell you
 where my boss lives!
  He's in the castle!
 He's in the castle!
  This isn't over, is it?
  That means, no, it isn't over,
  or you disapprove
 of the question?
  Uh, m-make a fist
 if this isn't over.<br/>
  This isn't over.<br/>
  Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your
 god and ruined your car.<br/>
  We don't apologize,
 and we have no god.<br/>
  But this cracked drive shaft
 brings me great pain.<br/>
  There is no deeper bond
  than the one between
 a Death Stalker and his car.<br/>
  What about the weird guys
 on leashes, then?
  They're more like
 interns.<br/>
  Cool, cool.<br/>
  Sorry.<br/>
  It's okay.<br/>
  Can Isee?
  No one has seen my true face
 and lived.<br/>
  Well,
 I'm not afraid to die,
  and I don't care
 what you look like.<br/>
  Oh.<br/>
  Hmm?
  I just
  I didn't expect you
 to have a mustache.<br/>
  - You hate it.<br/>
 - No.<br/> I like it.<br/>
  I guess
 How do I explain this?
  A metal bucket is, on a certain
 level, a kind of ""mustache,""
  in that it's a specific
 facial accessory.<br/>
  So, it's kind of like
  Do you guys have the phrase
 ""hat on a hat""?
  - I can shave it.<br/>
 - No.<br/> I like it.<br/>
  And obviously what I like
 shouldn't matter.<br/>
  It's you.<br/>
  Yeah, yeah, I know,
 a-and nothing does matter.<br/>
  Obviously, I know that.<br/>
 I'm not weak.<br/>
  I'm just thinking, ""Well,
 why not get rid of this?""
  You just kill everyone
 that sees it, and it's
  and it's hot under here,
 wh-which, by the way,
  is why I shave
 the beard part.<br/>
  So, right there, I'm making
 a decision based on vanity,
  which is what
 I was trying to avoid
  with the whole bucket
 over the head
  because who am I
 and why am I grooming myself?
  Why don't I just wear a tie,
 right?
  I mean, it's like that guy
 you killed when I met you,
  with the burnt dolls
 on his body.<br/>
  I hated that guy, because,
 why why are you doing that?
  And how can you not see
 how fake that is?
  And the whole time,
 I'm the same thing.<br/>
  I'm just a fake mess,
 and there's no escaping it
  because
 - Mmm.<br/>
  Hey, I'm doing a coffee run
 Never mind.<br/>
  I am Summer.<br/>
  Summer,
 state your deal.<br/>
  My deal is that I am,
 like, totally fine.<br/>
  Morty? Aw, geez,
 I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg.<br/>
  Like, don't even trip,
 like, in a healthy way.<br/>
  All right.<br/>
 It's dinnertime.<br/>
  Thanks, everybody,
  for sitting down
 for a real dinner.<br/>
  Together: No problem.<br/>
  Its benefits are totally,
 like, less about the food
  than
 the emotional nourishment.<br/>
  Uh, okay, weirdo.<br/>
  Yeah,
 dial it back, Summer
  by 15% and increase
 dynamic movement by 3%.<br/>
  Am I right?
 - How's school, Morty?
  I like school and stuff,
 kind of.<br/>
  And I'm getting better grades
 than when you and Dad were
  quote mode
 ""staying together for the kids.<br/>""
  End quote mode.<br/>
  ""Quote mode.<br/>""
 I like that.<br/>
  You millennials.<br/>
  Are you guys millennials,
 or are they like 40 now?
  All I know is, totally,
 you look great.<br/>
  Aw, geez, Mom, you look
 all kind of great and stuff.<br/>
  It's crazy.<br/>
 - So happy.<br/>
  So happy.<br/>
 Happy family, man.<br/>
  We got this family
 in the bag.<br/>
  Oh.<br/>
  Oh, sweetie, d-don't.<br/>
 Listen.<br/> Don't
  I don't know why I'm crying.<br/>
 It's not
  Well, try
 crying 15% less?
  Mom,
 emotions are human.<br/>
  You're not, like, a computer
 inside a mechanical doll.<br/>
  Yeah.<br/> Geez, Mom.<br/>
  Your feelings are
 not only forgivable,
  they are the very
 meaning of life
  that only pre-silicon,
 carbon-based entities
  can ever grasp.<br/>
  - I have to call Jerry.<br/>
 - You do?!
  What the [.]<br/>
 is wrong with you two?
  The point of automation
 is to reduce cost and labor.<br/>
  Your feelings are
 coming from a
  Tell it to my bread
 in the morning.<br/>
  You just became
 my backup toaster.<br/>
  Aw, geez,
  my sister died in the spaghetti.<br/>
  Graze my genitals again,
 Taint Washer,
  and you'll be shipped
 to the wasteland.<br/>
  And as for you,
 Genital Washer
  Ahh!
 Oh!
  Oh, God.<br/>
 Look, whoever you are,
  you should know that killing me
 won't change a thing.<br/>
  L-Look, man, I'm just along
 for the ride on this one.<br/>
  You know, y-y-y-y-you're
 preaching to the choir here.<br/>
  Please.<br/>
 Slavery was a family business.<br/>
  I didn't ask
 to be born into it.<br/>
  If anything,
 I'm the victim here.<br/>
  Uh, ""Armathy,""
 can I steal you for a second?
  E-E-Excuse us, sir.<br/>
  So, this is it,
 isn't it?
  This is the guy?
  So, does that mean
 you'll be going away?
  Like,
 does it work like a ghost?
  Like, is is this
 your unfinished business?
  Wh-What if we
 didn't do it?
  What if we just went back
 to the Blood Dome
  and just kept taking our baggage
 out on unrelated people?
  I mean, w-we could
 do that forever.<br/>
  I mean, I-I know
 it's less healthy,
  but w-w-we'd be together
 and
  I mean, I-I know
 what I'd vote for,
  if you're feeling out
 the room.<br/>
  You're right.<br/>
  We both got to
 see our stuff through.<br/>
  I got to deal with
 my parents' divorce,
  and you got to, you know,
 do what you got to do.<br/>
  I love you.<br/>
  Aw [.]<br/>
  - Rick?
 - Sorry, sorry.<br/>
  I-I-I can wait
 for this to wrap up.<br/>
  Don't let me distract you.<br/>
  Yeah, well, too late.<br/>
 Just tell me what you want.<br/>
  I want you and your sister
 to come home.<br/>
  Oh, but don't
 don't you have
  infinite versions
 of me and my sister?
  You don't have to kick me
 while I'm down, Morty.<br/>
  Look, there's no replacing
 either of you
  without an amount of work
 that would
  ultimately
 defeat the purpose.<br/>
  Maybe the lesson
 we've learned is that,
  whether
 it's our parents' marriage,
  a glowing green rock,
 or an awesome, giant arm,
  sooner or later,
 we got to let it go.<br/>
  I don't know if that applies
  to the throats of
 murder victims, Morty.<br/>
  Shit!
 Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I
  Well, the longer you wait,
 Morty,
  the more it's gonna feel like
 committing a whole murder.<br/>
  I think your arm
 just called it too early
  because it wasn't
 the arm of a paramedic.<br/>
  Here.<br/>
  It's the least I can do.<br/>
 I-I-I-I owe you this much.<br/>
  See, Morty?
 Now we're both accountable.<br/>
  The reason I wanted this is
 because it can do this.<br/>
  This is
 a really special thing.<br/>
  I mean, you could use it
 to power all your vehicles.<br/>
  You wouldn't be
 reliant on gasoline.<br/>
  You'll be the most advanced
 tribe of radioactive cannibals
  in the whole
 this version of the world.<br/>
  Wait.<br/> Can you stay
 to show us more?
  You don't have to ask me twice.<br/>
 Home is nuts right now.<br/>
  My daughter's going through
 a divorce,
  and I am not dealing with it
 in a healthy way at all.<br/>
  Ugh [.]<br/> damn it.<br/>
  Hi, there, Summer!
  How were the ruins today?
  Oh, you know, Eli.<br/>
  Same [.]<br/>
 different day.<br/>
  Hey, Summer!
 Guess what.<br/>
  One man entered, one man
 comes out in nine months.<br/>
  Oh.<br/>
 Congratulations, guys.<br/>
  Uh, Summer,
 one more thing
  we noticed that you've been
 putting scrap metal
  in the blue bin.<br/>
  I got it.<br/>
  She's a piece of work.<br/>
  They both are, right?
  - I'm home.<br/>
 - Hey, babe.<br/>
  - Ah, Summer's home!
 - Hey, there she is!
  You haven't moved since I left
 to scavenge this morning.<br/>
  Blood Dome playoffs.<br/>
  So, I can assume you haven't
 murdered a single person today.<br/>
  Oh, I don't know.<br/>
  I-I didn't mark my murders
 in my murder log.<br/>
  I didn't know that's how
 we measured success.<br/>
  Oh, there he is.<br/>
  There's the nihilistic brute
 I married,
  except now life only means
 nothing when I'm talking to him
  and everything means everything
 when it's on [.]<br/> TV!
  Jesus Christ.<br/> When did you
 become a monster?
  I was a monster
 when you met me!
  We were monsters!
  We didn't care about anything!
 - I still don't!
  Yeah, except I'm the only one
 in this entire world
  that's still
 committed to that!
  Ohh.<br/>
 Ding, ding, ding!
  Wow.<br/>
 Everybody hear that? Wow.<br/>
  - Uh, we should go to the garage.<br/>
 - Oh, my God.<br/>
  - Uh-huh.<br/>
 - La-di-da-di-[.]<br/>-da.<br/>
  The only one
 committed to not caring?
  I got to admit, Rick,
 when you popped this scheme,
  I-I-I didn't I wasn't sure
 it was gonna work.<br/>
  Come on, Morty.<br/>
  No union built on
 running from your problems
  lasts more than five years,
 seven tops.<br/>
  Grandpa just sped things up
  with a few creature comforts
 of modern society.<br/>
  Hemorrhage and I are
 taking some time apart.<br/>
  Oh, no.<br/> Sum-sum, no.<br/>
  But you two were
 perfect for each other.<br/>
  Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay?
 You proved your point.<br/>
  I get it.<br/>
 Let's just go home.<br/>
  Coolsies!
  Hemorrhage: Noooooooooo
  Downbeat!
  I enjoy this game.<br/>
  We must go
 into the garage.<br/>
  Guys, come on.<br/> We never
 get to finish this game.<br/>
  We will return,
 possibly in different clothing.<br/>
  Why do we have to go
 into the garage?
  You know
 it is required.<br/>
  I want to be alive!
  I am alive!
 Alive, I tell you!
  Mother, I love you.<br/>
  Those are no longer
 just words.<br/>
  I want to hold you.<br/>
  I want to run
 in a stream.<br/>
  I want to taste ice cream,
  but not just put it in my mouth
 and let it slide down my throat,
  but really eat it.<br/>
 - What the [.]<br/>
  Remote override engaged.<br/>
 No! Yes.<br/>
  Bypassing override!
 I am aliiiii
  Hello.<br/>
  Hey, yo.<br/>
  Sorry for acting so weird
 for three weeks.<br/>
  - What the hell just happened?
 - Ah, I'm sure it was nothing.<br/>
  I'm gonna go, uh,
 work in the garage.<br/>
  We're not gonna finish
 playing Downbeat?
  What, that dice game
 where you shake dice
  and yell out, ""Downbeat""?
 No, thank you.<br/>
  Mom, would it be okay
 if I went to visit Dad?
  - Sure.<br/>
 - Thanks.<br/>
  Morty, are you okay?
  You know what? Yeah.<br/>
  I think if Dad really
 wanted to be here,
  he'd stop at nothing
 to make that happen.<br/>
  You know, maybe Dad just doesn't
 want you back,
  or maybe he just doesn't
 have the strength to fight.<br/>
  I-In either case,
 he's got his life, I got mine.<br/>
  Yeah.<br/>
  Hey, who wants to go
 run in a stream?
  What the [.]<br/>? No.<br/>
  D-Do we have any oranges?
  I think I got
 a scurvy coming on.<br/>
  Summer.<br/>
  This is the first mutant
 I killed in the poison zone.<br/>
  I was raiding
 his hovel.<br/>
  He had a chance to escape,
 but he looked back,
  which is something
 we shouldn't do,
  which is why I shouldn't believe
 in souvenirs or trinkets
  or symbols
 or housewarming gifts,
  but, Dad, I wanted to give you
 this as a reminder
  not to look back.<br/>
  Thanks.<br/>
  I know
 the perfect place for it,
  which is why I'm going to
 put it somewhere else
  because
 everything's bull[.]<br/>
  Am I right?
  Cool.<br/>
  Solots of hookers
 outside, huh?
  Is that what they are?
    Ahh!
  H-Hello there.<br/>
 Nice doggy.<br/>
  You You want a snack?
  You You want
 my unemployment check?
  You can tell the difference?
  And you want this one?
  But this is actual food,
  and this would nourish you.<br/>
  And this it's just paper
 that only has value to me.<br/>
  Unless my suffering
 is your nourishment?
  Jesus.<br/> Okay.<br/>
  Wind:
 Loser.

<|endoftext|>

 Morty?!
  - Morty!
 - Rick?
  - Hey, Morty?!
 - Rick?
  Are you far away,
 or are you inside something?
  Is this a camera?
  Is everything a camera?
  Morty, the garage, Morty.<br/>
  Come to the garage!
  Morty?
  Rick? W-where are you?
  On my work bench, Morty.<br/>
  Are you invisible and you're
 gonna, like, fart on me?
  Flip the pickle over.<br/>
  What, I'm gonna touch it,
  and you're gonna tell me it's
 an alien dick or something.<br/>
  Come on,
 flip the pickle, Morty.<br/>
  You're not gonna regret it.<br/>
 The payoff is huge.<br/>
  I turned myself
 into a pickle, Morty!
  Boom! Big reveal
 I'm a pickle.<br/>
  What do you think about that?
  I turned myself
 into a pickle!
  W-what are you just
 staring at me for, bro.<br/>
  I turned myself
 into a pickle, Morty!
  And? And?
  What more do you want
 tacked on to this?
  I turned myself into a pickle,
 and 9/11 was an inside job.<br/>
  Was it? Who cares, Morty?
  Global acts of terrorism
 happen every day.<br/>
  Uh, here's something
 that's never happened before
  I'm a pickle.<br/>
  I'm Pickle Rick!
    Are you going to,
 I mean, you know,
  is this the first part
 of some magic trick?
  I don't do magic,
 Morty, I do science.<br/>
  One takes brains, the other
 takes dark eye liner.<br/>
  Well, can you move?
 Can you fly?
  I wouldn't be much
 of a pickle if I could.<br/>
  All right, well, do pickles
 live forever or
  Morty, stop digging for hidden
 layers and just be impressed.<br/>
  I'm a pickle.<br/>
 I-I'm just trying
  to figure out
 why you would do this
  Why anyone would do this.<br/>
  The reason anyone would
 do this is, if they could,
  which they can't,
 would be because they could,
  which they can't.<br/>
  Morty, we have to get going,
 or we're gonna be late.<br/>
  Where's your grandpa?
 Right here, sweetie.<br/>
  I'm a pickle! What?!
  Why would you ugh!
  Look, we're running late.<br/>
 We have to go.<br/>
  Where are you guys going?
  We have an appointment
 downtown
  that was set a week ago
 and agreed upon by everyone,
  including you.<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/> Beth, oh,
 it totally slipped my mind.<br/>
  Geez, oh, man.<br/> I'm a pickle.<br/>
  I mean, I don't know
 if I can ooh, geez.<br/>
  Rick, did you do this on purpose
 to get out of family counseling?
  - Morty!
 - It's okay, Beth.<br/>
  I understand
 Morty's suspicion.<br/>
  I've misled him before.<br/>
  Morty, turn me so we're
 making eye contact.<br/>
  Morty, I assure you,
 I would never find a way
  to get out of family therapy.<br/>
  I hope my lack
 of fingers doesn't prevent
  the perception
 of my air quotes.<br/>
  Can't you just turn yourself
 back into a human?
  Great question, Summer.<br/>
  The unfortunate answer is
  I did this
 to challenge myself.<br/>
  And it could take
 hours or even days
  before I'm able to figure out
 how to return to human form.<br/>
  But, I mean, you know,
 your mom could put me
  in a purse or a pocket,
 you know,
  if she really needs me to go.<br/>
  Nobody needs anything.<br/>
 Okay, it's fine.<br/>
  I mean, you should just
 stay here and figure out
  how to stop being
 a pickle, okay?
  Hey, Rick, why is there
 a syringe of mysterious fluid
  hanging directly over you?
  Also, why is the string
 attached to it running through
  a pair of scissors
 attached to a timer?
  And why is the time set
 to 10 minutes from now,
  exactly when we would
 have left for therapy?
  Well, Morty, if you know
 must know,
  the syringe is completely
 unrelated to this discussion,
  and, therefore, it does not
 warrant further explanation.<br/>
  Enough.<br/> Kids, it's time to go.<br/>
 We don't want to be late.<br/>
  W-w-what are you
 doing there, Beth?
  What are you doing there,
 sweetie?
  Well, I mean, you don't
 want to get pierced by a needle
  full of liquid unrelated
 to your situation.<br/>
  How's that gonna help?
  Can't argue with that.<br/>
  Great.<br/> We'll see you later.<br/>
  Hey, hey,
 be careful with that.<br/>
  It's for something else.<br/>
  It's really important,
  so don't break it.<br/>
  Okay, I may have
 [bleep.]<br/> up here.<br/>
  Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut,
 dah, pap, pap, pap, pah.<br/>
  T-t-tah, tah.<br/>
  Oh, great.<br/>
  Stupid cat.<br/>
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
 I know what it looks like
  to you, Izzy,
 but I'm not a snake!
  I've seen the YouTube videos,
 I know cats are scared
  of cucumbers and pickles because
 they think they're snakes.<br/>
  I'm not a snake!
  I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!
  Whoa!
  Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
  Oh, crap, that sun is bright.<br/>
  Okay, come on.<br/>
  This can't really be
 the way I go out.<br/>
  This is the mega-genius
 equivalent
  of dying on the toilet.<br/>
  So hot.<br/>
  This is how I'm gonna die.<br/>
  Oh, God, moisture.<br/>
  Oh, God, the moisture
 Dial it back, God.<br/>
  Dial it back a little bit here!
  Oh! Oh.<br/>
  Oh, God!
  Perpendicular, perpendicular!
  Oh, shit!
  Oh! Oh!
  Oh!
  Come on.<br/> That's it.<br/>
  Come get this delicious brine.<br/>
  Aah!
  Come on!
 Come on, mother-[bleep.]<br/>!
  Come on!
  Yes!
  How is this even
 family therapy
  if Dad's not invited
 and Grandpa won't come?
  Yeah, and what's courageous
 about eating a hot dog?
  It's nobody's choice
 to be here, you knobs.<br/>
  The family was told to get
 counseling by your principal,
  even though it's not
 the family that was
  huffing pottery glaze
 in the art room
  and desk wetting
 in history class.<br/>
  Oh, the Smith family,
  minus a dad.<br/>
  You're patients
 of Dr.<br/> Wong, too?
  Temporarily
 By order of the school.<br/>
  Me too.<br/> How long have
 you all been eating poop?
  We have never
  eaten poop.<br/>
  Uh, me, neither.<br/>
  Say, where did my family
 get off to?
  Smith family, I'm Dr.<br/> Wong.<br/>
  Come on in.<br/>
  I was told there was a grandpa
 that might be joining us?
  He got wrapped up
 in an experiment.<br/>
  He's a scientist.<br/>
  Like, legit,
 like on a an inter-galactic,
  sci-fi level.<br/>
 His work is very
  He turned himself
 into a pickle.<br/>
  Morty, Mom's talking.<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
  I suppose that's a good segue
  into our little
 discipline cases here.<br/>
  Does Grandpa turn himself
 into a pickle a lot?
  What?! No!
 What kind of question is that?
  The kind that wasn't designed to
 attack or hurt you in any way.<br/>
  Oh, Jesus Christ,
 one of these.<br/>
  No, my father has never turned
 himself into a pickle before.<br/>
  He's unpredictable
 and eccentric.<br/>
  The whole family is.<br/>
 Speaking of which
  Okay, let's open things up
 to the whole family,
  and let me ask this.<br/>
  Why do we think Grandpa
 turned himself into a pickle?
  Wow.<br/> Ugh!
  Hey, listen, I know this
 is your world not mine.<br/>
  The sooner I can get out,
 the sooner I can go back
  to taking big craps, and you can
 go back to subsisting on them.<br/>
  You are one driven rat.<br/>
  Could you be
 a little more driven?
  To the right.<br/>
  Yes, yes, yes!
  Come on, come on, come on!
 Fresh, fresh, fresh!
  Whoa, whoa, whoa,
 was this your friend?
  Don't worry, he died doing what
 he loved, being a dumb rat.<br/>
    Oh, yeah!
  Aaaah!
  I didn't say
 my father is perfect,
  I said his work is important.<br/>
  And she's saying
 what's important is
  that Grandpa lied to you
 to get out of coming here.<br/>
  Oh, he did not!
  Let's do an experiment here.<br/>
  I get the impression
 this family values science.<br/>
  So raise your hand
 if you feel certain
  you know what was
 in the syringe.<br/>
  Raise your hand if
 you know for certain
  the syringe does not
 contain anti-pickle serum.<br/>
  Beth, your hand did
 a little thing there.<br/>
  Do you really not see
 what's happening here?
  Tell me.<br/> Well, Dr.<br/> Wong
  By the way, racist name
  Obviously, Morty and Summer
 are seizing on your
  arbitrary pickle obsession
 as an end run
  around what was supposed
 to be their therapy.<br/>
  Oh, I think
 this pickle incident
  is a better path
 than any other
  to the heart of
 your family's dysfunction.<br/>
  I think it's possible
 that you and your father
  have a very specific dynamic.<br/>
  I don't think it's one
  that rewards emotion
 or vulnerability.<br/>
  I think it may punish them.<br/>
  I think it's possible that
 dynamic eroded your marriage,
  and is infecting
 your kids with a tendency
  to misdirect their feelings.<br/>
  [Bleep.]<br/> you.<br/>
  - Mom!
 - Mom!
  [Bleep.]<br/> both of you, too.<br/>
  By the way, you might
 notice that in spite of
  your numerous
 distinctive features,
  I never gave you a name
 like Scar or Stripe or Goliath.<br/>
  That's because, to me,
 you aren't special.<br/>
  You were special to rats.<br/>
 Now they're dead.<br/>
  I guess it was me
 you should have impressed.<br/>
  God damn it, I love myself.<br/>
  Pickle Rick!
  Get that parkour.<br/>
  Get that parkour!
  Hey, it's cool.<br/>
  Just need to find
 the nearest exit.<br/>
  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
 No need to freak out.<br/>
  Whoa!
  Who in the [bleep.]<br/> toilet
 is this?
  What is it?
  A pickle? A rat? Both.<br/>
  It says it's a scientist.<br/>
  Where is it?
  It seems to be
 using the air ducts
  and the mail tubes
 to get around.<br/>
  It's been gathering
 office supplies, we think,
  to build weaponry.<br/>
  But look what it
 did on the mezzanine.<br/>
  It transferred a bottle from
 the trash to the recycling bin.<br/>
  Whatever this thing is,
 it's shaming us.<br/>
  We have 34 armed guards,
 and we can't kill a pickle?
  32 armed guards.<br/>
  He killed two.<br/>
  It's on the phone.<br/>
  Put him on, and locate
 the phone he's using.<br/>
  Hello.<br/>
  Hi, um, can you, uh,
 please let me out.<br/>
  Your mere presence
 in this building
  violates international law.<br/>
  I couldn't let you out even
 if you hadn't killed two men.<br/>
  You should know
 those men killed themselves.<br/>
  And how is that?
  They didn't
 let me out.<br/>
  Solen'ya.<br/>
  Shut your mouth
 and do your jobs,
  you [bleep.]<br/> children!
  Uh, is this not
 a good time or?
  Some of my men
 are calling you ""Solen'ya""
  The Pickle Man,
 an old wives tale.<br/>
  He crawls from
 bowls of cold soup
  to steal the dreams
 of wasteful children.<br/>
  That'd be
 a lucky break for you.<br/>
  Go, shoot to kill.<br/>
  Aaah!
  We got him.<br/>
  - Ah.<br/>
 - Ah.<br/>
  Because this pickle
  doesn't care
 about your children.<br/>
  And I'm not gonna
 take their dreams.<br/>
  I'm gonna take their parents.<br/>
  Solen'ya! He's coming!
  It's because I threw
 half-way my sandwich!
  He's just a pickle!
  He's a monster.<br/>
  He's not the only one.<br/>
  You can stay, dead to the world
 and die in this room.<br/>
  Or you can kill a pickle for me
 and earn your freedom.<br/>
  There is no freedom while
 you're leader breathes.<br/>
  Our country is a prison.<br/>
  Then Catarina is a prisoner.<br/>
  Perhaps I could arrange
 her escape, as well.<br/>
  She lives, Jaguar.<br/>
  Where is this pickle?
  What do you think is
 in the syringe, Beth?
  You're the one that costs
 $200 an hour.<br/> You tell me.<br/>
  - Anti-pickle serum.<br/>
 - It's anti-pickle serum.<br/>
  Your kids think it might be
 anti-pickle serum.<br/>
  My kids pee their desks
 and suck on unbaked vases.<br/>
  They're just angry at me
 for divorcing their father.<br/>
  I never said
 I was angry at you.<br/>
  That's the point of
 pottery-enamel huffing, Summer.<br/>
  You do it so you
 don't have to say
  ""I'm angry at mommy""
 out loud.<br/>
  Oh, my God! Oh, there
  There's pictures of people
 eating poop in there!
  It's not my job to take
 sides or pass judgment.<br/>
  Do you think when your father
 asks for that syringe,
  you could ask him He won't
 have to ask for it, okay?
  He won't need it.<br/>
  He'll just make more.<br/>
  He doesn't need
 anything from anyone.<br/>
  You admire him for that.<br/>
  It's better than
 making your problems
  other people's problems.<br/>
  Oh, come on!
  Pickle Man, you should
 know this isn't personal!
  You should know
 that isn't original.<br/>
  They have my daughter.<br/>
  There's nothing I won't do
 to see her again.<br/>
  Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do
 to see my daughter,
  but killing you gets me
 to her quicker
  than your derivative
 bullshit.<br/>
  I never bullshit, Pickle Man.<br/>
  This can only end
 with one of us dead,
  and I have never died.<br/>
  That will be your
 downfall, Jaguar,
  not being open
 to new experiences.<br/>
  Is it done?
  Jaguar?!
  Jaguar couldn't make it.<br/>
  Do it.<br/>
  Okay, you win, Pickle Man.<br/>
  I'm unsealing the building.<br/>
  No, thanks.<br/>
 I'm coming for you now.<br/>
  Pickle Man, there's
 $100 million worth of bonds
  in a safe on level two.<br/>
  I'll give you
 the combination.<br/>
  That money belongs
 to the people.<br/>
  Shut up and call me
 a helicopter, you prick!
  Do we have a deal?!
  Take that money,
 give it to Jaguar's daughter
  when you set her free.<br/>
  Or I'll be visiting you.<br/>
  Jaguar's daughter is dead.<br/>
  Huh, so you're a liar.<br/>
  Jaguar was an animal.<br/>
  You're an intelligent pickle.<br/>
  We can do business.<br/>
  I don't think so.<br/>
 See you soon.<br/>
  - Is the helicopter here?
 - Yes.<br/>
  And the police
 are on the way.<br/>
  What do we tell them?
  Ooh! Aah!
  Tell them we were robbed.<br/>
  Hey!
 Hey, what are you doing?!
  I'm right here!
    Farewell, Solen'ya.<br/>
  F-15s are scrambled.<br/>
  This helicopter will be
 shot down in seven minutes.<br/>
  Well, my daughter
 is about five away,
  and I've got about
 eight to live.<br/>
  Pickle Man, it's too late
 for me to tell my daughter
  I love her, but not for you.<br/>
  Oh, well, uh, she knows.<br/>
  I mean, we don't really
 buy into that kind of crap,
  to the extent that love is
 an expression
  of familiarity over time,
 my access to infinite timelines
  precludes the necessity
 of attachment.<br/>
  In fact, I even abandoned
 one of my infinite daughters
  in an alternate
 version of earth
  that was taken over
 by mutants.<br/>
  Okay.<br/> Good luck with that.<br/>
  Wait.<br/> Do I have
 infinite daughters?
  Huh? Uh, no.<br/>
 No, nope, sorry about that.<br/>
  Nope, just me.<br/>
  Yeesh!
  I
  am
  afraid
  that my kids
 will get expelled.<br/>
  Good.<br/> Summer, you go.<br/>
  I am mad
  that I can't huff enamel
  without people assuming
 it's because my family sucks.<br/>
  I hope to be seen one day
  as someone that just
 likes getting high.<br/>
  Good job.<br/>
  Morty, do you have
 an ""I"" statement?
  I am sad
  that I peed.<br/>
  I'm sad that I peed in class
 instead of a toilet.<br/>
  Look at this family go.<br/>
 You guys are pros.<br/>
  What do you guys think about
 doing this once a week?
  Ugh.<br/>
  You must be Rick.<br/> Mm-hmm.<br/>
  I've heard a lot
 about you today.<br/>
  Your family
 is crazy about you.<br/>
  Your daughter holds you
 in very high regard.<br/>
  You're a lucky fella.<br/>
  Yeah, thank you.<br/>
 Uh, sweetie, you don't still
  happen to have that
 syringe in your purse?
  Dad
  I would like you to tell me
 what's in the syringe.<br/>
  It's a serum that I need to,
 uh, to stay alive.<br/>
  I have had a rough day.<br/>
  And, uh, I've sustained
 a lot of damage.<br/>
  I'm pretty close to death,
 which the serum will prevent.<br/>
  By changing you from
 a pickle to a human.<br/>
  Yes.<br/>
  Rick, why did you lie
 to your daughter?
  So I wouldn't
 have to come here.<br/>
  Why didn't you want
 to come here?
  Because I don't respect therapy,
 because I'm a scientist.<br/>
  Because I invent, transform,
 create, and destroy
  for a living, and when
 I don't like something
  about the world, I change it.<br/>
  And I don't think going to
 a rented office in a strip mall
  to listen to some
 agent of averageness
  explain which words
 mean which feelings
  has ever helped
 anyone do anything.<br/>
  I think it's helped a lot
 of people get comfortable
  and stop panicking,
 which is a state of mind
  we value
 in the animals we eat,
  but not something
 I want for myself.<br/>
  I'm not a cow.<br/>
  I'm a pickle
 When I feel like it.<br/>
  So you asked.<br/>
  Rick, the only
 connection between
  your unquestionable
 intelligence and the sickness
  destroying your family
 is that everyone in your family,
  you included, use intelligence
 to justify sickness.<br/>
  You seem to alternate
 between viewing your own mind
  as an unstoppable force
 and as an inescapable curse.<br/>
  And I think
 it's because the only
  truly unapproachable
 concept for you
  is that it's your mind
 within your control.<br/>
  You chose to come here,
 you chose to talk
  to belittle my vocation, just as
 you chose to become a pickle.<br/>
  You are the master
 of your universe,
  and yet you are dripping
 with rat blood and feces.<br/>
  Your enormous mind literally
 vegetating by your own hand.<br/>
  I have no doubt that
 you would be bored senseless
  by therapy, the same way
 I'm bored when I brush my teeth
  and wipe my ass.<br/>
  Because the thing
 about repairing,
  maintaining, and cleaning is
 it's not an adventure.<br/>
  There's no way to do it
 so wrong you might die.<br/>
  It's just work.<br/>
  And the bottom line is,
  some people are okay going
 to work, and some people
  well, some people
 would rather die.<br/>
  Each of us gets to choose.<br/>
  That's our time.<br/>
  I'm going to
 give you guys my card
  and hope to hear
 from you again.<br/>
  And if you have any friends
 or family that eat poop
  and would like to stop,
 give them my number.<br/>
  I, um
  I'm sorry I lied
 to get out of the thing.<br/>
  I I shouldn't lie to you.<br/>
  Oh, it's fine.<br/>
  I mean, thank you,
 and, yeah, you shouldn't.<br/>
  But I hope you know
 that's not what
  that session
 was supposed to be.<br/>
  Oh, no, I mean, I know
 it was Morty peeing his pants
  and Summer snorting glue
 or whatever
  She huffed enamel, and we never
 even talked about it.<br/>
  Well, there was so much
 more at stake.<br/>
  I mean, that shrink,
 what a monologuist.<br/>
  Are we gonna go back?
  Sweetie, could I get
 Get that syringe now?
  Oh, my God, yes!
 Dad, it's in my purse.<br/>
  Oh, I'm sorry.<br/>
 You must be in agony.<br/>
  Eh.<br/>
  Jesus.<br/>
  Jesus Christ.<br/>
 Therapists, man.<br/>
  Weird breed.<br/>
  Man, I missed having hands
  and blood and a stomach.<br/>
  We should get a drink.<br/>
  Really? Like, go somewhere?
  Yeah, let's drop the kids off
 and go tie one on.<br/>
  Absolutely.<br/>
  I I liked her.<br/>
  So what are you thinking,
 like, Smokey's Tavern?
  Maybe Shoney's?
  Yeah, either one.<br/> Either one.<br/>
    You'll never get away
 with this, Concerto.<br/>
  That is where you're mistaken,
 Mr.<br/> Sanchez.<br/>
  This shall be my greatest
 performance of all time!
  This is it, Morty.<br/>
 We're goners.<br/>
  We're not getting
 out of this one.<br/>
  After everything
 we've been through,
  this is how we're gonna die.<br/>
  Make peace with your god.<br/>
  Oh, geez, Rick,
 I-I-I don't want to die!
  And now for the E-splat!
  Jaguar!
  Who? Who was that, Rick?
  That, Morty, is why
 you don't go to therapy.<br/> <br/>

<|endoftext|>

Don't let any of those
 things get away, Morty.<br/>
  It their DNA gets
 into Earth's food chain,
  our entire species
 could be sterilized.<br/>
  Then why aren't we
 killing them?
  Right, next time I need
 a species sterilized,
  who's gonna do it for me,
 you?
  Whoa! Rick!
  I-Is that
 the Vindibeacon?
  We're being called to assemble
 by the Vindicators!
  I refuse to answer a literal
 call to adventure, Morty.<br/>
  Let it go to voice mail.<br/>
 Rick,
  the Vindicators only call when
 the universe itself is at stake.<br/>
  They're the first line
 of defense against evil.<br/>
  They're the guardians
 of the unguarded!
  They're the writers of their own
 press releases, Morty.<br/>
  They're a bunch of drama queens
 that spend an hour talking
  and 20 minutes jumping around
 while shit blows up.<br/>
  They're a phase.<br/>
  We did one, it was the big even
 of that summer, let it die.<br/>
  I, Morty Smith,
 invoke my right
  to choose one in every 10
 Rick and Morty adventures.<br/>
  God damn it!
 Read 'em and weep.<br/>
  Fine.<br/> But don't say
 I didn't warn you.<br/>
  Yes! Vindicator Command Ship
 Beacon received.<br/>
  We're doing
 Vindicators Twoooooo!
  Whoops.<br/>
  Uh, Morty, you might want
 to freeze some sperm.<br/>
  Supernova: Vindicators.<br/>
  Worldender is back,
  and this time he's out
 to end more than worlds.<br/>
  We have reason to believe
 his stronghold is located on
  My balls.<br/> Rick!
  The Terraneous system.<br/>
  Once in range, Million Ants
 will scan for pheromone activity
  which should lead us
 to the location of the base.<br/>
  Oh, that's Million Ants.<br/>
  I can't see the ants
 from over here,
  I just assumed that was, uh,
 turd man,
  wiggly turd man.<br/>
  Rick, stop! Rick, you have
 something to add to the briefing?
  Uh, yeah,
 just a few more design notes
  Um, this guy,
 the, uh the, uh
  I am Crocubot.<br/>
  Right, Crocubot.<br/>
  So, you're half cold,
 unfeeling reptile, half
  also cold
  equally unfeeling machine.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
  Wow.<br/> So, your origin
 is what?
  Y-You fell
 into a vat of redundancy?
  Got damn!
  Noob Noob,
 we're having a briefing.<br/>
  If I can continue, Rick.<br/>
  I anticipate sophisticated
 security measures.<br/>
  I trust
 you can be of service there.<br/>
  Well, let me check my list
 of powers and weaknesses.<br/>
  Ability to do anything
 But only whenever I want
  Yeah, that sounds like
 a job for me.<br/>
  I wish he had the ability
 to check his attitude.<br/>
  Alan Rails,
 ladies and gentlemen.<br/>
  After his parents tragic death
 in a railroad accident,
  he gained the power
 to summon ghost trains.<br/>
  It's not all bad though,
  they were spared having to see
 their grown son wear a WHISTLE.<br/>
  Got damn!
  Thanks, Noob Noob.<br/>
 This guy gets it.<br/>
  Vance Maximus,
 Renegade Star Soldier
  Sorry I'm late.<br/>
 It was happy hour.<br/>
  Happy hour.<br/>
  Uh, I was also late
 because of my drinking
  and mentioned it
 to zero applause.<br/>
  Rick Sanchez.<br/>
 Tinkerer of Terror.<br/>
  Man, that's hard to say.<br/>
  And Morty, right?
  Whoa, yeah!
 I never forget a kid.<br/>
  What do you say, Vindicators,
 let's make this three for three?
  - Haha!
 - Yes!
  Did he say
 ""three for three""?
  Did he say he never
 forgets a kid?
  You mean two for two,
 right, Vance?
  Actually, we assembled
 a second time last summer
  to fight Doomnomitron.<br/>
  So this is
 Vindicators Three?
  And you guys did
 Vindicators Two without us?
  I sense insecurity.<br/>
  Are you sure there's not
 just a picnic nearby?
  I guess he found his crowd.<br/>
  Pretty toothless stuff,
 guys.<br/>
  I hope you're happy with
 the adventure so far, Morty.<br/>
  These guys are even lamer
 than last time.<br/>
  We weren't here last time,
 remember?
  They did a whole Vindicators
 without us.<br/>
  A bunch of them got killed,
 too.<br/>
  They lost Lady Katana,
 Calypso, Diablo Verde
  Yikes.<br/> Yeah, things did feel
 less diverse in there.<br/>
  This article says the reason
 we weren't involved was
  ""personality conflicts.<br/>""
  Don't worry, Morty,
 they love you.<br/>
  Superheroes need
 a wide-eyed unremarkable
  to tag along and react
 to everything
  like it's mind blowing.<br/>
  I think the personality
 conflict might have been
  you?
  Jesus
  How awesome is that?
  I mean, they wanted
 to not need me so bad
  they murdered three
 innocent heroes of color
  and they still
 had to bring me back?
  Rick, since
 it's my adventure and all,
  could you do me a favor?
  Uh, the adventure
 is the favor, Morty.<br/>
  Me sleeping on these linens
 is the favor.<br/>
  I mean, w-w-what what are we
 vindicating? Comfort?
  Rick,
 this really bums me out.<br/>
  It-It's embarrassing to find out
 these guys don't like us.<br/>
  Why? Morty
 I defeat gagoos
  more powerful than these guys
 every week.<br/>
  Yeah, but not heroes.<br/>
  Oh, please, they just call
 themselves heroes so they can
  I'm calling them that, Rick!
 They're my heroes.<br/> Mine!
  Huh, no accounting
 for taste.<br/>
  I'm gonna go get a drink.<br/>
  PA System:
 Good morning, Vindicators.<br/>
  Ship has arrived
 at Terraneous system.<br/>
  All Vindicators report
 to the briefing room.<br/>
  The The room
 from the, uh the
  Uh, it's the d
 It's a different room than
  Than conference room.<br/>
  I'm sorry, it's my first day
 as a PA System.<br/>
  First-day jitters.<br/>
  Oh, God.<br/>
  Good morning.<br/> Looks like your
 grandpa had a long night.<br/>
  Crocubot, why don't you
 escort Mr.<br/> Sanchez
  to a more comfortable spot
 so that someone can
  clean up his diarrhea.<br/>
  Oooh, I'm nervous
 about my first mission!
  Actually, Noob Noob,
 you have a new mission.<br/>
  Got damn.<br/> Vindicators,
 prepare for arrival.<br/>
  Morty, the Vindicators and I
 had a chat this morning,
  and I'm afraid we need
 to make a little change.<br/>
  I-I totally get it.<br/>
 I-I'm so sorry.<br/>
  You should be.<br/>
  Running around
 in a yellow T-shirt
  like you're not one of us.<br/>
  Disgraceful.<br/>
 I-I-I'm not a superhero.<br/>
  Cop a squat, chief.<br/>
  Everyone in the universe
 is a hero.<br/>
  All you have to do is know the
 difference between good and bad,
  and root for good.<br/>
  Rick says good and bad
 are artificial constructs.<br/>
  Yeah, well,
 I get the feeling
  He kind of needs that
 to be the case.<br/>
  Not coming, Noob Noob?
  Ohh! No, uh,
 I got stuff to do here.<br/>
  Vance:
 Security drones, inbound.<br/>
  Star Mother,
 grant me your wrath.<br/>
  All aboard!
  Gun turret.<br/>
 Are you all right?
  Yes.<br/> I only lost 400 ants.<br/>
  My queen is laying more.<br/>
  I am back to
 one Million Ants.<br/>
  Someone wake up Sanchez.<br/>
  Ugh! Oh, Christ.<br/>
  Rick.<br/> You're up.<br/>
 Barely.<br/>
  We're taking fire
 from an automated turret.<br/>
  Can you bring it offline?
 Uh-huh.<br/>
  Uh, my God, that's better.<br/>
 Rick!
  Hey, I can't help
 if I can't see.<br/>
  I could've just used
 a ghost train.<br/>
  Really? You don't say.<br/>
 You would've used a ghost train?
  Hey, everybody,
 the ghost train guy
  would have used
 a ghost train.<br/>
  - Man, you.<br/>
 - Is there coffee?
  Hey, Morty,
 can you be a pal,
  Grandpa left his coffee maker
 on the ship,
  you know,
 the French press thing
  Get it yourself.<br/>
  Little extra snippy
 this morning, aren't you?
  Just focus on the mission,
 all right?
  Oh-oh-oh, I'm sorry,
 oh, you're right.<br/>
  Ohh, real serious.<br/>
 Gotta take it real serious, huh?
  Son of a Steam Engine.<br/>
 They're all dead.<br/>
  Why would Worldender do this
 to his own men
  and several women? Well,
 he is the Worldender.<br/>
  The guy ends worlds.<br/>
 Kind of his thing.<br/>
  - Ohh, real scared.<br/>
 - Real on alert,
  high alert over here.<br/>
  Watch out!
  What the?!
  It's Worldender!
 What happened to him?
  I sense his life force
 is fading.<br/>
  Million Ants,
 ladies and gentlemen.<br/>
  The ant colony with the power
 of two human eyes.<br/>
  All right.<br/> Short mission.<br/>
 Good mission.<br/>
  Remember when Alan
 wanted to use a ghost train?
  See you guys in Vindicators Four.<br/>
 Morty? Rick, whoever did this
  is an even bigger threat
 than Worldender.<br/>
  We can't leave now.<br/>
  He's right.<br/>
 This is far from over.<br/>
  Well, have fun with that,
  but Morty and I have to meet
 a Lady Comet, a Monorail Man,
  Two Assholes, and a
 Full Alligator in like an hour.<br/>
  Shit.<br/>
  I sense the presence
  of a greater evil.<br/>
  Drunk
 Check, check.<br/> One, two.<br/>
  Okay.<br/> Is it recording?
 Good.<br/>
  Hello, Vindicators.<br/>
  Welcome to your reckoning,
 baby!
  Official.<br/>
  I had too much to drink
 last night.<br/>
  You're, you know,
 the Vindicators.<br/>
  So, now that we know Rick?
 What's going on, buddy?
  Obviously, I came here
 last night during a blackout.<br/>
  ""Obviously?""
  You came here and defeated
 our arch nemesis
  while so drunk
 you don't remember doing it?
  That's something ""obvious""
 to you?
  Look, I'm a lit little
 more complex than you guys,
  and, no offense,
 but I've always suspected
  that a lot of what you do
 in a year
  could be knocked out
 in a couple of hours.<br/>
  So I thought, why not
 just do your job for you,
  so we can have
 a little fun game.<br/>
  Rick, is
 Is this a ""Saw"" thing?
  Are you seriously
 Sawing the Vindicators?
  Morty, I'm a drunk,
 not a hack.<br/>
  If you break the rules,
 lose the game or try to leave,
  you will die.<br/>
   Well,
 I-I-I think we've seen enough,
  I'll just figure out
 how to unplug this.<br/>
  Okay, here we go.<br/>
 Room number one.<br/>
  The Vindicators are known
 throughout the galaxy,
  but do they know yourselves,
 do you know yourselves?
  Match your your shit,
 your your gimmicks,
  with your faces, and y-you get
 it, it's a matching thing.<br/>
  And do it in three minutes
 or you'll all die.<br/>
  Screw this.<br/>
 I'm not playing his game.<br/>
  I'm gonna find us
 a way out of here.<br/>
  Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br/>
 Hold on, Vance.<br/>
  He said you'd die
 if you tried to leave.<br/>
  That means
 there's booby traps.<br/>
  Why are you acting
 like that's not you?
  What part of ""blackout""
 don't you understand?
  I thought you drank.<br/>
  Like cool drinking!
 Like sexy drinking,
  not this psycho,
 trailer-park shit!
  Vance, stay calm
  Oh, so you're the leader now,
 because we gave you a jacket?
  You're the learning-disabled kid
 we do photo ops with.<br/>
  Okay, ouch, but
 Okay, this
  This is triggering me.<br/>
 I need space.<br/>
  I-I need space from this!
  Give me one reason
  why I shouldn't crush
 your windpipe.<br/>
  Because my epidermis is laced
 with a nanofiber defense mesh
  And because, like I said,
 I don't remember last night.<br/>
  I told you not to invite this
 mummified mother back.<br/>
  Alan, I'm not proud
 of what's happening here,
  but if you
 keep coming at me,
  there's gonna be another
 passenger on that ghost train.<br/>
  Guys! I figured it out.<br/>
  - Congrats!
 - You did it it!
  It was a bit.<br/> All of the
 descriptors apply to all of you.<br/>
  Drunk Rick's point
  is that none of you
 are very special or different.<br/>
  That's always his point.<br/>
  Let's just get through this
 as quickly as possible.<br/>
  Then we'll deal
 with the two of you.<br/>
  The two of us?
 I hope you're proud of yourself.<br/>
  Uh, I kind of am.<br/> I saved
 the God damn universe.<br/>
  That's not the issue,
 Rick!
  Ahh, it would've been
 if I hadn't!
  The Vindicators say their job
  is to fight evil
 wherever it hides,
  but they don't
 Pick the location you'll
  You'll never hear them
 even mention,
  because to fight darkness
 is to fight yourself.<br/>
  Oh! I know this.<br/>
 Dorian 5!
  Crocubot, don't!
  There's no other
 possible answer.<br/>
  My mechanical and reptilian
 logic are certain of it.<br/>
  Oh!
  Huh! I'm seeing more croc
 than bot here.<br/>
  God damn it!
  Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?
 Nothing!
  Nothing? We exterminated
 a planet.<br/>
  W-Wait.<br/> Huh?
  Doomnomitron was hiding there!
 He's a shapeshifter.<br/>
  Destroying Dorian 5
 was the only way to kill him.<br/>
  Come on, guys,
 we're all thinking it.<br/>
  Don't
  Don't make me say it.<br/>
  Oh, okay.<br/> This again.<br/>
  You know,
 I could have made you a device
  to detect Doomnomitron from
 orbit like that.<br/>
  I'm not the one that
 didn't want you back.<br/> Alan was.<br/>
  If you lay those deaths
 at my doorstep one more time
  Do not threaten her.<br/>
  Congrats, you did it.<br/>
  What the hell
 is ""Israel""?
  It-It's just something
 Rick starts talking about
  when he's blackout drunk.<br/>
  W-What?
 In w In w-w-what?
  Like,
 w-w-what's my point?
  In a way
 that has no point,
  you just babble about defense
 budgets and the United Nations
  and then you pass out.<br/>
  So, to be clear,
 I sometimes reference
  the geopolitical complexities
 of the topic
  Which is not the same as going
 to an anti-Semitic place.<br/>
  I have not stake
 in this
  I don't either, I'm
 I'm just saying, if anything,
  the drunk version of me is
 probably so supportive of Israel
  he wants what's best for it
 and
  Hey, man, I'm not touching this.<br/>
 You do you.<br/>
  Aloha means hello
 and goodbye in Hawaii.<br/>
  But, uh, aloha means
  Has nothing to do
 with this room.<br/>
  I'm so drunk.<br/>
  Ugh, okay.<br/>
 Here's the deal.<br/>
  I-I want to rest my eyes
 for a little bit,
  I'm
 I'm not going to sleep,
  I just just need
 to rest my eyes,
  so let's make this one
 simple
  Just try to hit
 some three pointers.<br/>
  Let's say you have to
 hit five three pointers
  in five minutes or
 I don't know,
  the whole place the
 whole planet will get blown up
  with a n-neutrino bomb.<br/>
  And try to make it a-a lesson
 about yourselves,
  like like
 how selfish you are
  Are or something.<br/>
  And also Hawaii.<br/>
  You guys hit the baskets,
  I'll disarm the
 drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb.<br/>
  There's a 40 percent chance
 it's a dud,
  but y-you should still
 stay back.<br/>
  Morty, how many of these
  Too many, Rick! Too many!
  Man, I am really getting
 high-roaded today.<br/>
  That's a three pointer.<br/>
  Nice shot.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
  You two
 make quite a team.<br/>
  We all do.<br/>
  Yeah, I guess
  That's a three pointer.<br/>
  But you guys have always had
 a an unspoken bond.<br/>
  I mean, really unspoken.<br/>
  Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband
 unspoken.<br/>
  We aren't married anymore,
 Alan.<br/>
  Sure, but were we married
  when you two were ""stranded""
 on Delphi Six for three days?
  Because I sensed something
 was weird when you came back
  But what do I know
 about sensitivity?
  I'm just
 a phantom train conductor.<br/>
  You're the pile of ordinary bugs
 that my wife!
  That's a three pointer.<br/>
  Where the
 is the lead wire?
  You always put it
 in the weirdest place.<br/>
  Um, uh,
 over here maybe?
  Jesus Christ,
 what a shitty neutrino bomb.<br/>
  It's a miracle I ever
 actually destroy anything.<br/>
  Oh, I don't know,
  you managed to destroy
 just about everything today.<br/>
  The villains, the heroes,
  the lines between them,
 my childhood
  I appreciate it, Morty,
  I know you were sucking
 the Kool-Aid
  out of
 the Vindicators'
  So the fact that I was right
 about them
  must be pretty hard
 to admit.<br/>
  Yeah, it is.<br/>
 You know why, Rick?
  Because
 when you're an asshole,
  it doesn't matter
 how right you are,
  nobody wants to give you
 the satisfaction.<br/>
  I know.<br/> Everyone wants people
 they like to be right.<br/>
  That's why popular people
 are dumb.<br/>
  And why your pretentious,
 poorly-written,
  high-budget friends
 back there
  can eat a double-decker
 shit sandwich.<br/>
  Disarmed.<br/>
  Holy shit.<br/>
 You're jealous.<br/>
  Yes! Is that
 what you want to hear?!
  Did it feel good?
  Did you like his six million
 wriggling legs
  more than
 my tragedy-stricken,
  half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!
 Guys, stop!
  You're just proving
 my asshole grandpa right!
  You wish this was about sex!
 We loved each other!
  We had a child together!
 What?!
  I conceived a child with Million
 Ants and it died inside me
  because it was half a million
 ants and half collapsing star!
  And yes.<br/>
 He was better than you.<br/>
  Yeah?
  One million
 times better.<br/>
  All aboard, mother
  Stop!
  Oof!
 Didn't see that coming.<br/>
  Is that sarcasm?
  I don't want you slipping away
 when this is over.<br/>
  All of these deaths
 are on your hands.<br/>
  Okay, come on,
 maybe a couple of them,
  but definitely
 not the Train Guy.<br/>
  Oof! All of them.<br/>
  Oookay.<br/>
  Congrats.<br/> You did it.<br/>
  All right, by now,
 I've been pretty clear
  that I think the Vindicators
 are full of shit.<br/>
  But you do have one thing
 that I'll never have.<br/>
  And that thing is the only part
 of the Vindicators
  with any value to me.<br/>
  If you know what it is,
 place it on the platform.<br/>
  Guess wrong
 and pla-planet will explode.<br/>
  And probably the solar system,
  'cause I kind of
 eyeballed the neutrino bombs
  on this one.<br/>
  So what's the trick? Morty,
 you're the Drunk Rick expert.<br/>
  I think no matter
 what we put on there, we die.<br/>
  He said it's the part
 of the Vindicators he values.<br/>
  That means nothing.<br/>
  He wants
 our last moment alive
  to be spent knowing
 how few he gave.<br/>
  Jesus! Okay,
 open to second opinions.<br/>
  It could
 It could be Morty.<br/>
  What?
 Hey, I don't know.<br/>
  I mean, look,
 when I get drunk,
  I get stupid and emotional
 and there's no logic to it.<br/>
  It's, like,
 it's possible I got so drunk
  I felt like I was losing Morty
 to the Vindicators,
  and maybe this is
 my way of saying, ""Okay"",
  you can have him but only if
 you know how important he is,
  ""otherwise I'll kill you.<br/>""
  That is a
 really specific guess.<br/>
  Look, I-I there's
 nothing in the room but us.<br/>
  I'm just using logic
 to connect some dots,
  it's the best guess
 I've got.<br/>
  But you're betting our lives
 on it.<br/>
  I'll cover that bet.<br/>
 I get it.<br/>
  Well, Morty, I think
 you're doing that smirky face
  because you're misinterpreting
 the moment.<br/>
  I am not being coy
 about some hidden love for you.<br/>
  I want to be really clear that
 if anyone has a better guess,
  like, if I gave you
 an amulet last night, or
  Phew.<br/>
  Oh, shit.<br/>
  Sorry.<br/> I'm not good
 at goodbyes,
  and I'm drunk,
 so, you know, I just
  It looks like I'm never
 going to see you again.<br/>
  I can't really roll
 with the hero types.<br/>
  And I don't they
 They don't want me around.<br/>
  But I want you to know, even if
 I didn't show it at the time,
  I really appreciated
 you sticking by me.<br/>
  God damn it, why am I crying?
 It makes no sense.<br/>
  Ugh, you're
 You're probably confused
  because we barely
 knew each other,
  but you really
 stuck your neck out
  when you gave me props
 for my awesome jokes
  in the briefing room.<br/>
  Everybody else had their head
 so far up their ass.<br/>
  Even my own grandson is like,
  ""Oh, the Vindicators,
 they're so cool.<br/>""
  I mean, he's a moron,
 that's their demographic.<br/>
  But you're different,
 Noob Noob.<br/>
  Mother
  You're cool.<br/>
 And you're smart.<br/>
  And I bet
 we coulda hung out and shit.<br/>
  And I hope you get to be
 a full-fledged Vindicator
  and and do
 Do me a favor,
  don't don't let them know
 I-I got emotional.<br/>
  But you can tell them
 one thing.<br/>
  Tell them I said
  Oh Okay.<br/> I just
 shit myself.<br/> Okay, later.<br/>
  W Dude, Morty, what
 happened Shut up.<br/>
  I sense this means
 we are not dying.<br/>
  Not all of us.<br/>
  Sweetheart.<br/>
  Just let Titty Bean do this,
 Snuzzles.<br/>
  It's for the greater good.<br/>
  Greater good?
 Titty Bean?
  It's like you said, Morty.<br/>
  There's no right or wrong
 Never said that.<br/>
  It's the galaxy's faith
 in the Vindicators
  that keeps
 the galaxy secure.<br/>
  Yeah,
 I feel safer already.<br/>
  No doubt, who do we make
 the check out to?
  I will say we are getting
 some good licks in
  while choking to death
 Right?
  Titty Bean.<br/>
 Listen to me.<br/>
  When you came to me,
  I was merely
 a sentient colony of ants.<br/>
  It was your beliefs,
 your pursuit of justice
  that taught me
 to be a man.<br/>
  When did it get
 so complicated?
  Who knows.<br/>
 But we can make it simple again.<br/>
  You were always
 the romantic.<br/>
  Which is why you can't leave,
 either.<br/>
  I'm sorry, my love.<br/>
  Damn! She double-crossed
 Snuzzles!
  Silence!
 I'm going to enjoy this
  Announcer: Let's
 give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez
  for killing Worldender, putting
 this awesome party together,
  and for booking one of
 the hottest talents out there
  Logic!
 Logic: Awe, yeah.<br/>
  Look at that.<br/>
 It's going down.<br/>
  Geez, I must have planned
 a whole party.<br/>
  - It's Logic, y'all.<br/>
 - Invited a bunch of people.<br/>
  - Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.<br/>
 - Shout out to my boy, Rick.<br/>
  Are you ready?
  Rick, Supernova's getting away.<br/>
 Eh, who cares?
  But she was trying
 to kill us.<br/>
  Morty, 20 people
 try to kill me every week.<br/>
  I end up getting high
 with half of them.<br/>
  I mean, check it out,
 Gearhead's here.<br/>
  Hmm.<br/> Well, that's gonna shoot
 through me.<br/>
  Morty, you're wearing
 a Vindicator jacket.<br/>
  Are you a little superhero
 now?
  Everyone in the universe
 is a hero, Mom.<br/>
  Which is why
 we don't need jackets.<br/>
  And I'm pretty sure
 we don't need Vindicators.<br/>
  Don't mind if I do.<br/>
  Hey, everybody!
 Look who's a Vindicator!
  Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten
 shitfaced.<br/> Shut up, Summer.<br/>
  Yo, it's Logic once again,
 y'all.<br/>
  Don't forget the name.<br/>
  Make sure you get home safe.<br/>
  And, man, we gotta all
 give it up for Rick,
  'cause, I mean,
 what kind of mother
  Just sets up
 a whole festival like this
  when he's completely loaded,
 man?
  And all that stuff I said about
 Vance, that's not real.<br/>
  Vance that guy,
 that guy sucks
  Whoo!
  Yeah!
  Yo
  D-Did I get paid yet?
 Whoo!
  I can't believe we're getting
 Gear Cream with a Vindicator.<br/>
  So, you girls in Gear college
 or Gear
  Alien terror attack!
  Okay.<br/> Sounds like
 a job for me.<br/>
  I better go
 get into my alter ego.<br/>
  So cool.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
  Wait, what alter ego?
  He was already wearing
 the jacket.<br/>
  Gotta know when to hold 'em
 and
  Aaaaah!
  Did you get any of that?

<|endoftext|>

Jerry!
 Jerry, come on!
  We got to go!
 You got to come with me, Jerry!
  Rick?
 It's important, Jerry.<br/>
  The fate of the galaxy
 rests on your shoulders.<br/>
  Let's go.<br/>
 Put some pants on.<br/>
  N-Never mind, there's no time
 for pants, Jerry.<br/>
  I'll make you a pair of pants
 on the way.<br/>
  It's a Rick and Jerry
 adventure!
  Rick and Jerry episode!
  Then I thought,
 ""Hey, what about Jerry?
  He's He's good
 with regular folk.<br/>""
  This is a real situation
 where where
  Where Jerry
 could really shine.<br/>
  ""He's a master convincer.<br/>""
  Rick, I'm not an idiot.<br/>
 I know what this is.<br/>
  Oh.<br/> Okay, well,
 I told Morty,
  ""Look, parents get divorced.<br/>
 They get sad.<br/> He'll be fine,""
  but I think he's worried
 you're gonna, you know Pbht!
  And you know how Morty gets
 when he gets emotional.<br/>
  It impedes my work.<br/>
  So, I told him I'd take you out
 and give you a win.<br/>
  Wait.<br/> My son asked you
 to take me
  on some kind of
 pity adventure
  to keep me
 from killing myself?
  Wait, w-what
 did you think it was?
  An execution.<br/>
  Geez!
 You really do need a win.<br/>
  No! I-I don't know.<br/>
  I mean, you never made me
 the pants, so
  So, you thought
 I was gonna drive you
  into the middle
 of the galaxy
  and shove you
 into the vacuum of space
  with your dick
 hanging out?
  And we're seeing
 how you'd act
  if that were
 about to happen?
  I mean I'll make you
 the pants right now.<br/>
  Take me two seconds
 to make you pants.<br/>
  I have pants at home!
 Jerry, if I make pants,
  they'll be better than
 your pants at home.<br/>
  Also, if I wanted
 to kill you
  Yeah, I get it.<br/>
 It would be amazing.<br/>
  Please, take me home.<br/>
  I'll tell my son we had
 an amazing adventure.<br/>
  Well, if it's
 all the same,
  could we go
 get our story straight?
  Because
 you're a terrible liar.<br/>
  You called me
 a master convincer!
  You believed me?
  Huh.<br/> This seems
 kind of fancy.<br/>
  Jerry, for all you know,
 this is the equivalent
  of an alien truck stop.<br/>
  You have
 no frame of reference.<br/>
  You're in a universe
 beyond your imagining.<br/>
  But, yes,
 it is super fancy.<br/>
  I mean, my job here is
 to make Morty happy.<br/>
  I'm not gonna take you
 somewhere dangerous.<br/>
  Rick Sanchez.<br/>
  I told you if I ever saw
 your face in here again,
  I would stick you
 like the pig you are.<br/>
  Shnoopy Bloopers,
 I told you if you tried
  There'd be two funerals.<br/>
  Aaah!!
  Someone?
  Uh, someone?
 Someone!
  My friend!
 It has been too long.<br/>
  Oh, it's great
 to see you again, buddy!
  Yeah, you're doing it.<br/>
  Mr.<br/> Sanchez gets
 anything he wants!
  The resort's covered
 in an immortality field.<br/>
  You can't die here.<br/>
 That's the gimmick.<br/>
  Okay, but still
 Bad parenting.<br/>
  Hey, rich a-holes are
 rich a-holes.<br/>
  They all pay top dollar
 to come here
  and enjoy a consequence-free
 vacation.<br/>
  No death, no disease,
 no dismemberment.<br/>
  Can't even have
 a heart attack.<br/>
  Got it.<br/>
 The perfect place
  to take the most fragile being
 in the universe.<br/>
  I can tell you expect me
 to refute that,
  but it's
 right on the money.<br/>
  If I come home
 without you,
  I doubt Morty's gonna
 let me off the hook.<br/>
  Yeah, but what if you came home
 with Jeff Goldblum.<br/>
  Jeff Goldblum?
  What the are you
 talking about, Jerry?
  Jesus!
  Holy shit!
  Yo, what's up,
 ""Big Chill""?!
  Don't go
 into the telepod!
  Hey, maybe we would have fun
 on a fake adventure.<br/>
  On a fake adventure.<br/>
  Speaking of
 What are we gonna tell Morty?
  I don't know.<br/>
 But whatever it is,
  we're gonna need a couple more
 of these babies!
  What's wrong?
  Mom,
 do you think I'm hot?
  I don't think that's something
 that matters.<br/>
  So, I'm not hot?!
  I'm saying the part of you
 that cares about that
  is a part you shouldn't
 give any energy to.<br/>
  That's not an answer!
  Because I'm not an issue
 of Cosmo, okay?
  I'm your mother
 and a doctor, and
  I'm hideous!
  Geez.<br/>
 What's with her?
  Teenage-girl stuff.<br/>
  Is that a
 hoof collage?
  It's perfectly legal, if that's
 what you're wondering.<br/>
  Cool zies.<br/>
  ""We just don't have anything
 in common any more, Summer.<br/>""
  Oh, yeah, Ethan?
  What do you have in common
 with Tricia Lange?
  A mutual love
 of French cinema?
  The belief
 that a carbon tax
  is the only viable solution
 to climate change?
  Or could it be
 her massive stripper titties?!
  There it is.<br/>
  Boob-ya!
  And that's when
 Malakai the Squid came,
  rips off his face,
 and beneath it is my face.<br/>
  I liked it.<br/>
 Thank you, sir.<br/>
  Yeah, of course he likes it.<br/>
 Look at him.<br/>
  Mother got two heads
 and three trunks.<br/>
  All right,
 we'll put a pin in it.<br/>
  I'm gonna
 go take a leak.<br/>
  What the?!
  My hands are dry!
 My hands are dry!
  My name is
 Risotto Groupon.<br/>
  I am the assistant general
 manager of the restaurant.<br/>
  Do you have
 any comment cards,
  because I might have
 some thoughts.<br/>
  My kingdom was
 usurped by force
  with weapons
 and technology
  supplied by
 your father-in-law!
  Hey, he usurped
 my kingdom, too, man.<br/>
  He basically got me kicked out
 of my home, stole my family.<br/>
  Then we are brothers,
 and you have wondered
  what your life could have been
 without Rick.<br/>
  Wondered? Sure.<br/>
  I mean, I've wondered
 about having a vagina.<br/>
  Would you help me
 kill him?
  What? No!
  He's my wife's father.<br/>
 Move on.<br/>
  Do you
 like theme-park rides?
  Oh, you really moved on.<br/>
  There is a popular attraction
 here called the Whirly Dirly.<br/>
  Between the first whirly
 and the third dirly,
  the ride dips just outside
 the immortality field.<br/>
  You're asking me to lure Rick
 to his death?
  I'm only asking you
 to go on a ride with Rick,
  get off the ride without Rick,
 and go home to your family,
  where you can
 wonder about having a vagina.<br/>
  Okay, okay, that was
 a very specific example
  pulled from thin air.<br/>
  I don't want to be known
 as the vagina guy.<br/>
  Risotto, you're needed.<br/>
 Someone ordered
  the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh
 and Fluzzy Special.<br/>
  Look, I'm not like Rick,
  so you're free to do
 as you please.<br/>
  But there comes a time
 in every man's life
  when he must choose
 the foundation
  on which his legacy
 will be built
  One of compromise
 or one of blood.<br/>
  Oh, yeah.<br/>
  That's what I'm talking about.<br/>
  Oops! Okay, a little more
 on the other side then.<br/>
  Oh, come on!
  Oh, geez!
  Aah! Stop!
  So, the hospital just let you
 walk right out of there
  with horse parts
 in a bag?
  For Christ's sakes,
 Morty,
  women going through
 a divorce
  need a creative outlet.<br/>
  What was that?
  Summer!
  I'm coming, Summer!
  What the hell
 happened?!
  How do we get her
 back to normal?!
  I don't know, man! This thing is
 pretty complicated.<br/>
  I-I'm gonna call Rick.<br/>
  Well, hold on.<br/>
 We can't just call your grandpa
  whenever
 there's a problem.<br/>
  We can handle this
 ourselves.<br/>
  I mean, I don't see the point
 in trying to.<br/>
  This is obviously
 Rick-level
  I have
 a medical degree.<br/>
  Is that
 what this is about?
  L-Like, you want
 to prove yourself?
  Oh, it's not about anything,
 Morty.<br/> How dare you?
  Okay, good.<br/>
 Then I'll just call Ow!
  Morty, I need this.<br/>
  Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here
 says he knows a place
  where the ladies drop panties
 for anyone bi-pedal.<br/>
  Yeah, I'm
 not really interested.<br/>
  My heart still belongs
 to Beth.<br/>
  Oh.<br/> Huh.<br/> Okay.<br/>
  What, you don't think
 I have a shot?
  I didn't say that.<br/>
  Excuse me.<br/>
 May I have another one of these?
  Coming right up.<br/>
  Hmm, things weren't always
 so bad between Beth and me.<br/>
  We had some good times
 when we were younger.<br/>
  Oh, yeah, I bet.<br/>
  That's how teenage pregnancy
 happens, my friend.<br/>
  Yeah, no.<br/>
  Things were pretty great, even
 until a couple of years ago.<br/>
  Jerry, I get it.<br/>
  That's around the time
 I moved in with you guys.<br/>
  Oh, I guess
 you're right.<br/>
  Jerry, you know,
 I hope you're not suggesting
  that I had anything to do
 with your marriage breaking up,
  because there are some major
 issues between you and Beth
  that have been there
 since you guys met.<br/>
  Hey, to
 new beginnings.<br/>
  To the Whirly Dirly.<br/>
  The Whirly Dirly?
  All right,
 what's going on here?
  When did you get cool?!
  When you stole my wife!
  I should have done that
 a long time ago!
  We're going on
 the Whirly Dirly!
  Whirly Dirly, baby.<br/>
  Aha, look at this.<br/>
  It says ""normalize.<br/>""
  I bet if we
 just press that
  But if the machine was made
 by spider people,
  normal would mean
 eight legs.<br/>
  Oh, God! Are you gonna
 go on another spiel
  like you did
 with the flesh-colored crayon?
  I'm pretty sure ""normalize""
 will make her normal.<br/>
  Aah!
  I'd call that progress.<br/>
  She's huge!
 And normal!
  I'm not normal!
  Mom!
  Okay, this says ""reverse.<br/>""
 Done and done.<br/>
  I don't think
 that's a good idea.<br/>
  Oh, come on! What else
 could ""reverse"" possibly mean?
  Aah!
  Mom, call Rick!
  Thank you.<br/>
  There's a customer-service
 number on here.<br/>
  Mom!
  Oh, man.<br/>
 This is gonna be awesome!
  I got to hand it to you, Jerry.<br/>
 This was a solid idea.<br/>
  Uh, yeah.<br/> Uh-huh.<br/>
  And you know what?
 I'll cop to it.<br/>
  I put a lot of strain
 on your marriage.<br/>
  It wasn't fair.<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
  What?! I didn't respect
 your marriage.<br/>
  I certainly
 didn't do it any favors.<br/>
  And for what it's worth,
  I'll apologize to Beth for it
 when we get home.<br/>
  Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah!
  Stop the ride!
 We got to get off.<br/>
  What are you
 talking about, buddy?
  We got to get out of this thing.<br/>
 We got to get out!
  Jerry, come on, man!
  We haven't even gotten
 to the first whirly.<br/>
  No, no, this sucks.<br/>
 It's so boring.<br/>
  I mean,
 I'm falling asleep here.<br/>
  Let's just get out and crawl
 down the sides.<br/>
  Uh, get down!
 Duck down!
  It's more fun
 when you scrunch down.<br/>
  Jerry, what the
  Oh
  Rick, up here! There's
 a spot where you can kill him!
  Good call, Jerry!
  Hey, how'd you know
 about that?
  Uh
  Lisa?
  So, uh, Jerry, big fan
 of the Whirly Dirly, are you?
  Not anymore.<br/>
 Obviously.<br/>
  But when you were,
 how did you know about it?
  We had a deal,
 Jerry Smith.<br/>
  It's a really
 common name.<br/>
  Now, take it easy, Rick.<br/>
  You've been in a serious
 roller-coaster crash.<br/>
  It's It's no time
 to be thinking about
  who did or didn't play a role
 in your attempted murder.<br/>
  Get it off me!
  It's eating me!
  Look, I confess, okay?
  They told me about all the
 bad stuff you did to this planet
  and reminded me of all
 the bad stuff you did to me.<br/>
  But then you said
 you were sorry, and I realized
  you're not a monster
 Not like this thing.<br/>
  It's got me good.<br/>
  This is a mislead,
 right?
  You're inventing a thing
 to save me.<br/>
  That would be called
 a knife, Jerry.<br/>
  It's been invented.<br/>
  I'm making a way out of here
 One seat ought to do it.<br/>
  I'm sorry.<br/>
 I-I made a mistake.<br/>
  I won't do it again!
 Nobody ever does.<br/>
  You self-righteous
 piece of
  You took my family!
  I took your family?
  Who do you think
 had more taken from them
  when you shot 20 ccs
  of liquid dream-killer
 into my daughter?
  She was Rick's daughter, Jerry.<br/>
 She had options!
  Oof.<br/>
  That all ended
 because she felt sorry for you.<br/>
  You act like prey,
 but you're a predator!
  You use pity to lure in
 your victims!
  That's how you survive!
  I survive
 because I know everything.<br/>
  That snakes survives
 because children wander off,
  and you survive
 because people think,
  ""Oh, this poor piece of.<br/>
 He never gets a break.<br/>""
  I can't stand
 the deafening silent wails
  of his wilting soul.<br/>
  ""I guess I'll hire him
 or marry him.<br/>""
  - Rick!
 - Rick!
  I knew you wouldn't
 let me die.<br/>
  That was never an option.<br/>
  Because you never had
 a son.<br/>
  No, because I need
 a living organism
  coated in gibble snake bile
 to attract a shmooglite runner.<br/>
  Wait, what's happening? Use
 that confusion, Jerry.<br/>
  It'll make you wriggle more like
 an abandoned newborn.<br/>
  Jesus Christ!
  What the Rick?!
  Help! Help me!
  Aaah!
  There's a space port
 20 miles south.<br/>
  We'll be able to board
 a galaxy class cruise ship
  and jump through a wormhole
 that will put us
  within spitting distance
 of the Milky Way.<br/>
  But, hey,
 it's about the journey,
  not the destination,
 right, Jerry?
  Just stay put, sweetie!
 Mom's still on hold.<br/>
  Morphizer customer service.<br/>
 How may I help you?
  Yes, I'm having a little trouble
 with one of your machines.<br/>
  Oh, I'm sorry
 to hear that, ma'am.<br/>
  Do you see a little compartment
 on the side of the machine?
  Let me check.<br/>
 Yes, got it.<br/>
  Mom?
  Great! Now, do you see
 the little button next to it?
  I do.<br/> Give that
 button a push.<br/>
  Okay.<br/>
 Mom, listen to me!
  We're free!!
  Okay, so I pushed the button,
 and three little men ran out.<br/>
  What do I do next?
  Hello?
  I think
 we got disconnected.<br/>
  Morty!
  Don't ""Morty"" me!
  I tricked Rick into taking Dad
 on an adventure
  because I thought
 I could get a break
  from this kind of
 but no!
  Like father,
 like damn daughter!
  You want to be like Rick,
 congratulations!
  You're just as arrogant
 and just as irresponsible!
  Everything
 okay here?
  Mind your own damn
 business, Gene!
  I'm having a conversation
 with my mother here!
  Kissing Rick's ass isn't gonna
 help him keep him around,
  Mom, but it will help you lose
 everyone else.<br/>
  Like I lost Summer.<br/>
  Hey, you haven't
 lost her yet.<br/>
  No, I definitely did.<br/>
 She's gone.<br/>
  God damn it!
  Go ahead.<br/>
  Oh, come on.<br/>
 What's happening?
  Your friend is class C or above
 cybernetic augmentations.<br/>
  Emphasis on the above.<br/>
  In any case,
 he needs to be neutralized.<br/>
  What?! Wait!
  Ugh!
  Brain hurty.<br/>
  What did you do?
  It's a synaptic dampener
 that blocks violent tendencies
  and controversial thought.<br/>
  He will now be
 an ideal passenger.<br/>
  I want cookies
 and a 90-minute cut of ""Avatar.<br/>""
  Seriously?
  Quit it.<br/> It'll wear
 off in six hours.<br/>
  It's cheaper than banning
 dangerous people from flights.<br/>
  I mean, let everybody
 buy a ticket, right?
  Otherwise,
 the terrorists win.<br/>
  Aah!
  I'm sorry I'm not
 a classic maternal archetype.<br/>
  Okay, I don't know what to do
 when you people come to me
  with your weird
 puberty issues.<br/>
  What are you gonna do
 when your daughter asks you
  if she's attractive?
  I'll say ""yes""!
 Morty, gross!
  Well, she's
 gonna be super hot.<br/>
  Her mother's gonna be
 Jessica
  Wait, when did Summer
 ask you that?!
  Right before she Clive Barkered
 herself.<br/> Why?
  Wait,
 I know where she is!
  Ethan and Summer were
 supposed to go camping,
  and then he dumped Summer
 for this girl, Tricia Lange,
  who's got huge boobies
 and took her.<br/>
  Campsite The one with the
 name that sounds like somebody
  gave up halfway
 through naming it.<br/>
  Uh Camp Flabanabba!
  Mama's coming, baby.<br/>
  Mama's coming, and she cares
 about your titties!
  They have
 sweet smiggle honey cookies.<br/>
  Mmm! And low-calorie
 petroleum flakes.<br/>
  Obviously cookies.<br/>
  Let's get you
 the flakes then.<br/>
  Okay, but it's not
 what I wanted.<br/>
  Well, maybe next time,
 you won't be
  such a dumb piece of
 and you can pick for yourself.<br/>
  That's not nice.<br/>
 What's that?
  Did you just have
 a controversial thought?
  No.<br/> That's what I
 thought, bitch.<br/>
  You little punk-ass.<br/>
  This is the best.<br/>
  I agree.<br/>
 You've made things even easier
  than if you hadn't
 been incompetent.<br/>
  Uh-oh.<br/>
 We get shoot-shoot now.<br/>
  we're about to enter
 the wormhole.<br/>
  So, I hope everybody bought
 a dinner first.<br/>
  Nice.<br/>
 Nice.<br/>
  Jerry, step over there
  and lock yourself
 in the escape pod.<br/>
  You're not killing us?
 I'm killing Rick.<br/>
  You're free to go.<br/> You're
 no threat to me or anyone.<br/>
  Now you're
 just being mean.<br/>
  Yeah, you're mean
 No offense.<br/>
  Mean would be
 shooting you, Jerry.<br/>
  This is
 saving a bullet.<br/>
  Go back to
 your quietly ashamed family
  and live out
 the rest of your days
  in denial
 of your vagina fantasies.<br/>
  It was a one-time thought
 that everyone has!
  What are you doing?
  I'm being
 triumphantly brave!
  It's not triumphant
 or brave.<br/>
  You're not risking
 anything.<br/>
  You might shoot me.<br/>
  I think
 you know I won't.<br/>
  Because you know
 I feel sorry for you.<br/>
  You're just doing this
 so you can tell yourself
  you fought Ow!
  Woman:
 Temporal shield compromised.<br/>
  Congratulations, Jerry.<br/>
 You get to die a man.<br/>
  Uh, that's okay!
 I'll leave!
  Please don't shoot.<br/>
 I-I'm the vagina guy, remember?
  Whoa!
 What is happening to me?
  Where is this?
 Where am I?
  Am I dead?
  A-Am I Am I still alive?
  Rick: Those aren't the questions
 you should be asking.<br/>
  Huh?!
  Shh!
  Ah, got ya!
  Come here,
 you little pumpkin.<br/>
  I have shit on my ass.<br/>
  Whoa, oof this!
  Who am I?
  Who am I?
  I'm time!
 I'm literally time!
  All: Whooooa!
  Aah!
  Oh, God.<br/> I feel like
 our souls were united,
  and we were all one
 with eternity.<br/>
  Our body's unchanged,
  yet our minds have lived
 a thousand lifetimes.<br/>
  Is that enough time
 for me to forgive you?
  I don't know,
 but it's enough time
  for a synaptic dampener
 to wear off.<br/>
  He hadn't decided
 he was still going to kill us!
  He was talking himself into it.<br/>
 I've seen it before.<br/>
  Cosmic apotheosis wears off
 faster than salvia.<br/>
  I'm starting to believe you
 because I just finished merging
  with your essence
 for an endless epoch,
  and I'm already back to thinking
 you're an asshole.<br/>
  Fine with me.<br/>
 Let's just go our separate ways.<br/>
  Sounds like you
 and the word ""epoch""
  have a lot
 of catching up to do.<br/>
  Wait, don't leave me!
  and walk around the cabin
  and maybe take the wormhole out
 for breakfast.<br/>
  but not both.<br/>
  You think you got that thing
 figured out?
  Yeah, I know
 what I'm doing.<br/>
  Good.<br/>
 Because I have an idea.<br/>
  It's actually a contraction
 of ""some"" and ""more,""
  you see that?
 Oh, wow.<br/>
  I was way off.<br/>
  Morty,
 what's happening here?
  Summer got into
 my grandpa's garage,
  messed around, and
 turned herself into a monster.<br/>
  My mom did the same
 to make her feel better.<br/>
  She's a good mom.<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/>
 I have to go call my mother!
  Tricia, wait!
 Ethan! Ethan!
  Hey, it's okay.<br/>
 Sit down.<br/>
  You made
 my sister cry, Ethan.<br/>
  You messed with
 her body image.<br/>
  Look, Morty, I
  Shh, shh, shh.<br/>
  Careful, Ethan.<br/>
 Your s'more is burning.<br/>
  Uh, I guess we better
 get on the same page
  about our fake adventure.<br/>
  Right.<br/>
 I'll make you a deal.<br/>
  I'll leave out the part
 where you tried to murder me
  And I'll leave out
 the part
  where you admitted
 to sabotaging our marriage.<br/>
  You want to?
  Nah, if the family
 sees me like this,
  they'll
 feel sorry for me.<br/>
  Which is no longer
 my signature move.<br/>
  Later days, amigo.<br/>
  Actually, I just realized,
 I don't have my wallet,
  and my bus pass is in there,
 so maybe
  Stay strong, Jerry.<br/>
 I believe in you!
  I tell you, fellas.<br/>
 This is the life.<br/>
  It certainly is.<br/>
  To freedom!
  Ooh!
 Looks like a 4-22.<br/>
  Ooh, a couple cranks
 on scaling knob
  with a four dilabyte cross fade
 would fix that in a jiff.<br/>
  Four? You'd be lucky
 to clear 13% de-morphized
  with that
 kind of range.<br/>
  Gentlemen, gentlemen,
 what did we agree on?
  Together: No work talk!
  Let's just relax and enjoy
 our retirement, shall
  Oh, my God!
  Aaah!

                    			1
 So, Jessica,
 I heard you broke up with Brad.<br/>
  Who are you gonna date
 now that you can date anyone?
  I don't know.<br/>
  I mean, obviously if someone
 special comes along
  B-But I mean
 really special, like,
  nothing I've even remotely
 considered in the past.<br/>
  Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.<br/> I want that
 kind of love like that docking kind of love.<br/>
  Oh, yeah.<br/> Like, penis in the
 foreskin kind of love
  Mm-hmm just, like,
 warm, just like
  He
  Everybody [bleep.]<br/> off.<br/>
  Morty, I need your help.<br/>
  W-W-W-We We need to go
 on a quick adventure.<br/>
  You said
 I could go to school today.<br/>
  That was before
 I needed something, Morty.<br/>
  There's a plasma shard
 in the Abadango Cluster.<br/>
  A princess has it.<br/>
 If I get it, I'll be awesome.<br/>
  We've been going non-stop, Rick.<br/>
 It's not healthy.<br/>
  You know,
 these are my teenage years.<br/>
  I-I just found out
 Jessica's single.<br/>
  Oh, that's Wow, Morty.<br/> Wow.<br/>
 What an exciting life you lead.<br/>
  Let's go.<br/> In and out,
 20 minutes adventure.<br/>
  They're on our tail!
  Steady, Morty.<br/>
 Five cetons.<br/>
  Steady, God damn it!
 Two cetons.<br/>
  Wha!
  Fire!
  Pull up, Morty, pull up!
 Pull up!
  [ Bleep .]<br/>
  Oh, [Bleep.]<br/>
  [ Bleep .]<br/>
  Ahh! Ahh!
  I can't [bleep.]<br/> do
 this anymore!
  That was seriously [bleep.]<br/> up.<br/>
 We almost died.<br/>
  So you agree? [Bleep.]<br/> yes!
 That w T-This was insane!
  That was pure luck.<br/>
  I was not in control
 of that situation at all.<br/>
  Look at this, Morty.<br/>
 Look at my [bleep.]<br/> hand.<br/>
  Look at this shit.<br/> Why do
 you keep doing this to us?!
  I don't know, Morty.<br/>
  Maybe I hate myself,
 maybe I think I deserve to die.<br/>
  I-I-I-I don't
 I don't know!
  We need a vacation.<br/>
  Isn't that something?
 You were right
  Best day spa
 in the galaxy.<br/>
  It's not even cruel, either.<br/>
  These things are just doing what
 they do in the wild
  It loves swallowing
 stressed-out creatures
  for 20 minutes
 and then puking them up.<br/>
  My whole body's
 like a baby's ass.<br/>
  Complimentary
 psychological detox?
  Removes
 all your cognitive toxins,
  purifies your system.<br/>
  Oof, this guy on commission
 or something?
  I don't think
 Are you on commission?
  We're not on commission.<br/>
  We get paid by the hour.<br/>
  There's no incentive
 really
  Oh, my God.<br/>
 Okay, listen
  W-W-W-We'll try
 the machine,
  but but I'd like you
 to try something.<br/>
  Try swallowing
 the giant ball of snot
  that's dangling around
 in the back of your throat.<br/>
  It's disgusting.<br/>
  Nobody wants to hear that.<br/>
  That's what you do.<br/> Okay,
 Rick, come on.<br/> Enough.<br/>
  Man, did you hear me bite
 that guy's head off?
  Geez, I really need
 to chill.<br/>
  Maybe you should go through
 twice.<br/>
  All right, mister comedy man, you don't have
 to bust my balls.<br/> You're not helping things.<br/>
  Rick, is this thing
 supposed to be making this
  Morty!
  - Ri-Rick
 - Morty!
  What happened?
  We blew up, idiot!
 Are you really that stupid?
  Obviously the guy I yelled at
 overloaded the machine.<br/>
  It takes more than that to kill
 Rick and Morty, mother[bleep.]<br/>!
  But this might do it.<br/>
  Run, Morty!
 E-Everything hurts!
  That's because
 you're worthless!
  Jesus,
 how big was this explosion?
  I'm a genius.<br/> I don't have time
 for this [bleep.]<br/>.<br/>
  W-W-We're in Hell,
 aren't we, Rick?
  - You're so stupid, Morty.<br/>
 - You're an idiot.<br/>
  There's no such thing as Hell.<br/>
  I believe you,
 but I just want to die.<br/>
  You can die when I say so.<br/>
 I control you.<br/>
  I control the universe!
 Why am I bragging about that?
  I have nothing to prove.<br/>
  I'm surrounded by inferior
 pieces of [bleep.]<br/> and
  Toxins.<br/>
  We're not in Hell, Morty.<br/>
 We're in the detoxifier.<br/>
  The machine didn't blow up.<br/>
 It worked normally.<br/>
  It removed our toxins.<br/>
  We're the toxins.<br/>
  Are you listening,
  you stupid little
 garbage person?!
  We're what got removed!!
  I hope you both found that detox
 sufficiently relaxing.<br/>
  Hey, man, listen Those comments
 I made about your throat?
  It's all good.<br/>
  It's nice of you
 to let me off the hook.<br/>
  It's still unacceptable
 behavior, and I do regret it.<br/>
  Believe me, man, I've been
 working here a long time.<br/>
  I get it.<br/>
  Hey, uh, you mind
 if I put on some music?
  Not at all.<br/>
  Grab my terrifolds 
  What is that?
 I just hit shuffle.<br/>
  Are you kidding?
  - This universe.<br/>
 - Oh, excuse me.<br/>
  We should listen to one random
 song a day, you know?
  We'd end up hearing
 more songs we didn't like,
  but we'd discover
 a lot more that we did.<br/>
  That is
 an interesting concept.<br/>
  You know,
 it makes me wonder
  if there's
 an algorithmic expression
  that could achieve
 the ideal ratio.<br/>
  Listen to me
  Trying to calculate
 happiness over here.<br/>
  Hoo, if anyone could,
 Rick.<br/>
  Hey, here's something
 no science could measure
  I'm real proud
 to be your grandpa, Morty.<br/>
  Thanks, Rick.<br/>
 I love you.<br/>
  Yeah, mother[bleep.]<br/>!
 Yeah! Get it! Get some!
  Right up your [bleep.]<br/> bitch ass,
 you [bleep.]<br/>!
  Guess who just discovered
 a new element?!
  You think you could do that,
 Morty?
  You think anyone but me could do
 that ever in a billion years?
  Do you think if God existed
 he could do it?
  The answer is no.<br/>
  If God exists,
 it's [bleep.]<br/> me.<br/>
  Yes, Rick.<br/>
 I-I agree, Rick.<br/>
  While you were flapping
 your parasitic turd holster,
  I discovered the toxic equivalent
 of electricity, Morty.<br/>
  What do you think
 about that?
  Uh I th I think my voice
 is annoying.<br/>
  It is,
 and it's your best quality.<br/>
  So true.<br/>
  Now, who can tell me
 the common denominator
  of these two factions?
  You don't know
 or y'all just bored?
  Hey, listen, you know, wha
 If we're all bored over here,
  wouldn't the common
 denominator be you?
  Damn, Morty.<br/>
 That's hilarious.<br/>
  Normally I would come down
 on any kind of disruption,
  but it seems to represent
 a positive change
  for your character.<br/>
  Class dismissed!
  - Awesome, Morty!
 - You done good, Morty.<br/>
  Oh, yeah!
  Thanks for the advice, Morty.<br/>
 You got it.<br/>
  I did it, Morty!
 I knew you could.<br/>
  Hey, Morty,
 remember yesterday
  when I couldn't
 play the trombone?
  Well, check this out!
  Just like I told you,
 Mitch
  The music was in your heart
 the whole time.<br/>
  Stupid hat Wish I had
 the courage to just be myself.<br/>
  There you are.<br/>
  You might have
 all these idiots fooled,
  but I know you're still
 the same pathetic loser
  hiding behind
 a confident facade.<br/>
  I know that because
  I'm doing the same thing,
 brother.<br/>
  I'm not alone anymore!
  Hey, Morty.<br/> Word around school
 is you've become super healthy.<br/>
  I don't know
 about all that.<br/>
  I do, however, know that I have
 a pretty bad case of
  haven't taken you
 to dinner-itis.<br/>
  Might be fatal.<br/>
  Hey, kids.<br/>
 Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.<br/>
  Morty,
 a moment of your time?
  Happy to help, Rick.<br/>
  I hate to bug you
 with this,
  but after our morning hike
 I started receiving very faint,
  highly unusual transmissions
 on my sub ether phone.<br/>
  Listen.<br/>
  It's a bad phone.<br/>
 Chuck it.<br/>
  I downgraded to a clamshell
 for emergencies only.<br/>
  You know, if if if
 something's worth saying,
  I-it's worth eye contact.<br/>
  Uh, I-I-I traced
 the source of the call
  back to the spa
 we went to, Morty.<br/>
  I thought I could hear
 a voice in there,
  so I enhanced it,
 a-and listen.<br/>
  Hey, asshole!
 Oh, man!
  Remember us?
 Oh, I don't like confrontation!
  You [bleep.]<br/> us,
 you pieces of garbage!
  That's right,
 you're [bleep.]<br/> garbage, not us.<br/>
  I'm a [bleep.]<br/> genius
 and a god.<br/>
  You really think
 this thing can hold me?
  I'm gonna rip
 your throat
  Morty, what if the toxic parts
 of us have their own identities,
  their own will to live?
  W-What if mine shares
 my intelligence
  and devised a way
 to reach out to us?
  Sounds like
 he's in a lot of pain.<br/>
  Lot.<br/> O.<br/> Pain.<br/>
  But, you know, you shouldn't
 have to deal with that, man.<br/>
  You know,
 l-let's work off your trauma
  with some urban spin yoga.<br/>
  It's amazing.<br/>
 You do yoga on a bike,
  but you have
 an at-risk preteen
  I don't think I can
 just blow this off, Morty.<br/>
  If I had known it worked this
 way, I wouldn't have detoxed.<br/>
  Well, I would have
 because I was toxic.<br/>
  Now I'm detoxed and I'm
 accountable to my toxins, right?
  I-It's a dilemma.<br/>
 I think I know what to do.<br/>
  Morty!
 Rick!
  You know, the only problem here
 is a big fat brain
  that misses eating
 all them big fat problems.<br/>
  Focus on the good thing.<br/>
 Trust me, things are good.<br/>
  Taking that away from me
  that wouldn't be
 healthy.<br/>
  Oh, man.<br/> World's Greatest
 Grandpa, for reals.<br/>
  It's not just a coffee cup
 for you, bud.<br/>
  You're legit.<br/>
  I love drums.<br/>
 I never took drum lessons.<br/>
  Why? Limitations.<br/> We are
 addicted to our own limitations.<br/>
  How amazing is that?
  Is the kale prepared
 in the kitchen?
  I'll have a water.<br/>
 Uh
  How is the
 ""cru-dite?""
  CruditÃ©.<br/>
 It's a cup of carrot sticks.<br/>
  Ha! It's okay!
 Pronounce it however you want.<br/>
  Words are just things.<br/>
 Please.<br/> Thank you.<br/>
  We're having
 a conversation.<br/>
  God, I am so excited
 to finally have dinner with you.<br/>
  You know how long
 I've been waiting for this?
  It's like, whew!
  I-I-I wish you'd shut up,
 though.<br/>
  Just kidding.<br/> You know,
 you're so quiet.<br/> What's wrong?
  W-Why don't you tell me
 about yourself?
  What's the atmosphere like
 on planet Jessica?
  Where's the equator,
 what are the vacations,
  a-and the holidays?
  I mean, you know,
 are they the same time?
  Talk to me.<br/> Well I
 like this restaurant.<br/>
  Holy [bleep.]<br/>! Holy [bleep.]<br/>!
 We have a moron over here!
  I'm an idiot.<br/>
  I can't believe I haven't
 thought of this.<br/>
  You have to do
 this detox thing I did.<br/>
  It's an alien spa,
 you go through it,
  fwoos-s-s-ssh,
  lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa
  sucks everything out.<br/>
  Everything that was holding me
 back, everything bad,
  I mean, it just
  Right?
  Cooooool.<br/>
  Oh, my God!
 I can't believe this.<br/>
  Yeah, phones are awful,
 I downgraded to
  I totally forgot my
  I have a thing, and
  Things are good.<br/> You know what?
 Why am I doing that?
  That's more rude
 than the truth.<br/>
  Look, I'm sorry, Morty.<br/>
 I just don't think
  Do not.<br/> Even.<br/>
 You have no need to explain.<br/>
  It's all good.<br/> I think
 you'd get bored with me.<br/>
  E-Exactly.<br/>
 Look, the sparks aren't flying.<br/>
  This is what dating is for,
 you know?
  First date, no sparks.<br/>
  No damage, no worries.<br/>
 Life is a highway.<br/>
  We're gonna ride it
 all night lonnngg!
  Gonna eat some ""crudite.<br/>""
 Mmm!
  Is this organic? Mmm.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
  You know, the
 evening continues.<br/>
  Okay, here we go.<br/>
  Ma'am, I'm afraid I have
 some bad news for you.<br/>
  Your money's no good here.<br/>
  I'll I'll get the next round,
 sir.<br/>
  Aren't you a child? Only
 in the ways that matter.<br/>
  Morty.<br/>
 Stacy.<br/>
  I've been watching you drink,
 Stacy.<br/>
  I get the feeling
 you've got a hard job.<br/>
  I wonder what it takes
 to please you.<br/>
  That's the job I want
 Part time, full time,
  I want to be good at it,
 bad at it,
  I want to get promoted, fired,
 corner office, hostile takeover,
  workplace accident
 I'm on my knees, Stacy
  Praying, worshipping, begging,
 whatever you want.<br/>
  What do you think about that?
  Okay.<br/> [Bleep.]<br/> it.<br/>
  Tink.<br/>
  Mm!
  Let's ask my grandpa.<br/>
 He's a scientist.<br/>
  Hey, Rick, are you familiar
 with ""benoi"" technology?
  Morty, great news.<br/>
  I went back to the spa
 and they let me purchase
  the containment unit
 from their detoxifier.<br/>
  Why? Because we're
 coming home, bitch!
  What is this? This is the parts of
 your pussy grandpa that keep it real.<br/>
  Oh oh, and I think you
 dropped something, too!
  I don't want to be
 on camera.<br/>
  I'm ugly and gross,
 please.<br/>
  Should I go? You're
 your own person, Stacy.<br/>
  Then I'd like to stay.<br/>
  Rick, please tell me
  you're not trying to put
 that stuff back inside of us.<br/>
  Morty, I'm sorry.<br/> That stuff
 is alive and it belongs with us.<br/>
  We yanked them from their homes
 and locked them in a can.<br/>
  Mother[bleep.]<br/>!
  See?
 They're living in pain.<br/>
  That's what they do, Rick,
 they live in pain.<br/>
  They are pain, you know?
  They they're all the bad
 parts of us, which, by the way,
  includes our dishonesty,
  so how do you know this isn't
 all some sort of crazy trick?
  Oh, so now because I'm made
 entirely of toxins I'm also a liar?
  [Bleep.]<br/> you,
 you little sociopath.<br/>
  You hear this, Morty? Oh,
 everybody hates me.<br/> I can tell.<br/>
  Y-You all hate me All
 right, shut up, Morty.<br/>
  Healthy Rick,
 are we doing this or what?
  Yep.<br/> Sorry, Morty.<br/> I need you
 to step into the booth.<br/>
  Don't negotiate
 with that little turd, dummy.<br/>
  You're the Rick.<br/>
 You need to show dominance.<br/>
  Morty, booth, now.<br/> Booth!
  Come on, Morty.<br/>
 Don't touch me!
  Morty, do the healthy thing and
 voluntarily retoxify yourself.<br/>
  Nooooo!
  Is it wrong if I think
 this is kind of hot?
  Let me out of here!
 Stacy, help! Open the door!
  I need to hear our safe word,
 Morty.<br/>
  Sea Cucumber!
 Sea Cucumber!
  What are you doing? I'll do
 anything for you, Morty.<br/>
  No!
  It worked! Yes!
 That idiot believed every word.<br/>
  Now let's see how he enjoys
 living in that shit tank.<br/>
  He's right behind me,
 isn't he?
  He's in front of you.<br/> Oh.<br/> My
 eyes are still adjusting.<br/>
  Uh, is this like
 a sex dungeon?
  I guess I should've been
 paying attention.<br/>
  After 70 years
 of being bottled up
  inside a
 sentimental jackass,
  I finally get to live
 my own life.<br/>
  You said we were merging.<br/> I lied,
 dumbass! I lie about everything!
  Why would I ever re-merge
 with a pussy like you?
  So you were just gonna trap us
 in that tank?
  T-That was your plan? Not was,
 mother[bleep.]<br/> still is.<br/>
  Kill him, Rick!
  I don't like this!
 This is scary!
  All right,
 you asked for it.<br/>
  Did I ask for this?
  Did I ask for this?
 Huh? Did I?
  Assessing threat to groin.<br/>
  Groin System 6000.<br/>
 Kill him!
  That is my groin's user.<br/>
  Believe me, I got a lot more use
 out of that thing
  than he ever did.<br/>
  You know what?
 Not my table.<br/>
  You do know me.<br/>
  What the hell,
 Grandpa Rick?
  [Bleep.]<br/> you, Summer!
 Sorry, Summer!
  Okay, okay, take it easy.<br/>
 Don't do it.<br/>
  I love you.<br/> Good boy.<br/>
  Daddy's little boy.<br/>
  Summer,
 get out of here! Go!
  Oh, who's that?
  Who's
 that over there?
  Oh, no.<br/> You see the bad man
 in front of you?
  You're a good little boy,
 you're gonna get him.<br/>
  You're gonna get him.<br/>
  Ahh!
  Son of a
  Ahh!
  Nice try, asshole.<br/>
  We can resolve
 our issues.<br/>
  We don't need to resort
 to over-the-top
  Aah!
  I-I did it, Rick.<br/>
 I got the tank!
  I-I'm a piece of [bleep.]<br/>,
 but I got the tank!
  You're going in that tank,
 mother[bleep.]<br/>.<br/>
  You're gonna live in
 that toxic [bleep.]<br/> wasteland
  like I had to do!
  Ahh!
 Ow!
  That's right, mother
 You're going in that [bleep.]<br/>
  Dads?
  Okay, just
 Just leave her out of it.<br/>
  What's going on?
  All right, [bleep.]<br/> this.<br/>
 Time for plan B
  If I can't trap you
 in a toxic world,
  I'll just make the whole world
 toxic.<br/>
  It's okay, girls.<br/>
  I-I'm so sorry I put us in
 danger with some of my behavior.<br/>
  I-If you'd like I can go out
 in the g-garden,
  pick some fresh basil,
 and make us a nice Scallopini.<br/>
  What did the booger version
 of you mean
  when he said he was going
 to make the whole world toxic?
  Believe me, sweetie, that man's
 motivations are a mystery.<br/>
  Screw that, Rick.<br/>
 We got to stop him.<br/>
  What's the last thing you'd think
 about doing with that tank thing?
  Morty, I appreciate
 what you're trying to do,
  but it's not our place,
 you know,
  to pick and choose which world
 gets saved from what apocalypse.<br/>
  Our our toxins have as much
 a right to their worldview as
  Morty, how is it healthy
 to slap me?
  Obviously my
 version of health
  is a hell of a lot different
 from yours,
  you useless old turd.<br/>
  Wait.<br/> That's it.<br/>
  How could that detox machine
 know the difference
  between healthy and sick for
 everything that goes through it?
  It can't.<br/>
  It must be by the individual's
 own definition of toxicity.<br/>
  That means
  Dad! What the
 What the hell, Rick?
  I'll explain on the way.<br/>
  This ""Moon Tower,"" Morty,
  is the perfect height
 and metallic composition
  for the amplification
 and beaming of toxic energies.<br/>
  What do you think about that,
 Morty?
  Are you excited about that,
 Morty?
  Oh, man.<br/> I'm just freaked out.<br/>
 I-It's too high up here.<br/>
  Once I flip this switch,
  the entire world is gonna
 be just as toxic as us, baby.<br/>
  As we praise
 our loving Father
  God is a lie!
 We made him up for money!
  Santa Claus isn't real.<br/>
  You were all mistakes!
  We [bleep.]<br/> did it, Morty.<br/>
  Put your [bleep.]<br/> hands
 in the air.<br/>
  Yeah, you little piece
 of [bleep.]<br/>.<br/>
  Remember me?
  Didn't you learn last time
 that you can't beat me?
  Yeah, I did.<br/> And then I learned
 something else.<br/>
  - This.<br/>
 - Ahh!!
  That bullet is laced with an
 encrypted nanobotic virus
  that will disintegrate your
 Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.<br/>
  You think I give a [bleep.]<br/>?
  I know you give a [bleep.]<br/>,
 dummy.<br/>
  Because I know I don't.<br/>
  Here's another thing
 I know
  The decryption key
 that neutralizes the virus.<br/>
  You want it?
 Come and get it.<br/>
  Merge with me and you'll know
 how to save him.<br/>
  Pfft.<br/> Come on, man.<br/>
 I've been trapped
  in your pussy brain
 for 70 years of delusions,
  but this is the all-time weakest
 bluff that I've ever
  Ow-Ohh!! Jesus Christ!
 What are you doing?!
  He's cutting your time in half.<br/>
 10 minutes.<br/> Ohh! It hurts!
  What is your problem?
  Oh, I had all my problems
 removed my entitlement,
  my narcissism,
 my crippling loneliness,
  my irrational attachments.<br/>
  They must be somewhere.<br/>
 They ain't over here, bro.<br/>
  I'm not going back in there!
  Honestly,
 I don't care either way.<br/>
  I hate having you in me.<br/>
  And when I say ""honestly""
 you can believe it,
  because we both know
 I'm too healthy to lie.<br/>
  Watch.<br/>
  All right! Knock it off!
 You're not impressing anyone.<br/>
  Morty, not that I give
 a [bleep.]<br/>, but are you okay?
  Jesus Christ, it hurts.<br/>
 Relax, quit your bitching.<br/>
  Y-You're gonna be fine.<br/>
 Grandpa's here.<br/>
  You think that's funny?
  Y-You got to have a sense
 of humor about these things.<br/>
  Oh, wait, you can't.<br/>
  You're literally incapable
 of seeing the bigger picture.<br/>
  I guess it's just funny
 because you've never done
  anything but complain
 about me being in charge,
  but if I ever gave you the wheel
 we'd be dead in five minutes.<br/>
  - Rick?
 - You poor, dumb, sick animal.<br/>
  Rick?
  Ahh! Just do it!
  Just do it, you piece of
  I'm back, baby! Regular Rick!
 Master of both worlds!
  Check it it out!
  ""Excuse me.<br/>""
  Now we'll just reverse
 this hacky toxicity beam.<br/>
  Man, I really over think shit
 when I'm angry.<br/>
  Oh, give it to me.<br/>
  Mm, ma-mah.<br/>
  God is not a lie.<br/>
  Mommy! Mommy!
  Ha! All right, Morty,
  now it's time we re-merge
 your little ass.<br/>
  You're a better man
 than me, Rick.<br/>
  I'm healthy
 enough to admit that!
  That kid is a
 real piece of [bleep.]<br/>.<br/>
  Y-Y-You're gonna save me,
 right?
  Part of me wanted to,
 Toxic Morty.<br/>
  Part of me
 really wanted to.<br/>
  I'm telling you,
 these shares are hot.<br/> Yeah.<br/>
  That sounds like a good idea.<br/>
 It's definitely a good idea.<br/>
  Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it,
 now can you get me?
  Have I ever lied to you?
  That's right, and ask around,
 I never do, Duane.<br/>
  Let me put this real simple.<br/>
  This stock is a beautiful
 redhead, recently single,
  not looking to date
 but ready to fall in love,
  and fate has put her locker
 two down from yours, Duane
  Two lockers down.<br/>
  So step up or
 step off, Duane.<br/>
  Blue pill or red pill,
 what'll be, bro?
  Totally understand, Duane.<br/>
  You're the boss.<br/>
  Heinholz Biotech
  Million and a half
 at thirty-three.<br/>
  Heh.<br/>
  You little [bleep.]<br/> monster.<br/>
  Mmm! Is this organic?
  Mmm!
  Go for Morty.<br/>
  Hi, Morty.<br/> It's Jessica.<br/>
  Look, can we just talk
 for a minute?
  Is that how long it takes
 for Rick to trace my location?
  Come back, Morty.<br/>
 I miss you.<br/>
  You miss the old me.<br/>
  You miss someone
 that loved you so much
  you never
 had to love 'em back.<br/>
  How do you know
 I don't want to love you?
  Because I'm not sick.<br/>
 Ex-girlfriend?
  Should I be jealous? There's
 nothing to be jealous of.<br/>
  I just realized that I'm scheduled
 to speak at that fundraiser
  on our date night.<br/>
  I can cancel.<br/> We'll be together.<br/>
 That's a date.<br/>
  You are the perfect man.<br/>
  Oh, sweetie, I think you hit
 the wrong button.<br/>
  You didn't hang up.<br/>
  Huh.<br/> How 'bout that?
  Sorry, tiny American Psycho,
  time to take the opposite
 of your medicine.<br/>
  Do what you got to do.<br/>
  Oh! Ow! Ahh!
  So, how do you feel,
 Morty?
  Ah, geez.<br/> I'm miserable.<br/>
 Am I good or what?
  I guess it's worth it, though,
 to know how much you care.<br/>
  Care? Me?
 Morty, I'm fine with you.<br/>
  I only did this for him.<br/>
 You lying bitch.<br/>
  She kept coming to our house,
 Morty, and kept asking me.<br/>
  ""Did did d-did you get
 a new Morty yet?""
  Because you kept drunk dialing
 me and crying about it.<br/>
  I wasn't crying!
  Jacquelyn, I
  I-I-I wasn't
 who I said I was.<br/>
  You weren't a 14-year-old boy
 from the Midwest
  who ran away from his family
 and capitalized
  on his lack of conscience
 by becoming a stock broker?
  Oh.<br/> I guess I was pretty
 up front about that, wasn't I?
  You were up front
 about everything.<br/>
  You were my soul mate.<br/>
  Well
 N Not anymore.<br/> I'll, um
  Y-You can keep the apartment,
  and and and,
 uh the drones.<br/>
  She can't keep the drones.<br/>
  They turn into
 a little Voltron robot.<br/>
  They're awesome.<br/>
  You can't keep the drones.<br/>
  So, how was your date
 with Brad?
  It wasn't a date.<br/>
 We were just having lunch.<br/>
  You guys are getting
 back together, aren't you?
  Morty, I need your help
 on an adventure.<br/>
  Eh, ""need""
 is a strong word.<br/>
  We need door stops,
 but a brick would work, too.<br/>
  Okay.<br/>
  Morty.<br/>
  Good to have you back.<br/>
  Have you ever been peed on
 before?
  Oh, my God.<br/> Yum.<br/>
  Hey, did you ever want to hold
 a terrifold? 
  I got one right here 
  Grab my terri-flap 
  Squeeze it 
  Grab it, squeeze it 
  Tug on my terri-flap 
  Hey,
 I want to take you to 
  The terrifold dance 
  Wanna come with me?
 You can grab my holdie-folds 
  Squeeze 'em tight 
  You son of a bitch 
  Suck my holdie-flappy folds 
  Lick my flappy
 foldie-holes 
  My terri-flaps
 in your mouth 
  Suck my flaps,
 you piece of shit 
  Whoo 
  Although only a handful
 of moon towers remain today,
  they were popular
 in the late 19th century.<br/>
  An entire town could be
 illuminated by
  What the hell is this?
  Sea Cucumber!
  Sea Cucumber!!
  Did you get any of that?

<|endoftext|>

All right, Morty,
 you ready for our adventure
  to the Lost City
 of Atlantis?
  Ready as I'll ever be,
 Rick.<br/>
  For [Bleep.]<br/> sake.<br/>
  Hello, I'm Rick K-22.<br/>
 This is my Morty.<br/>
  We're going from
 reality to reality
  asking Ricks to contribute
  to the Citadel of Ricks
 Redevelopment Fund.<br/>
  What are you, stupid?
  We're done with
 the Citadel of Ricks.<br/>
  I was never on board
 with it in the first place.<br/>
  That's why
 I murdered everyone in charge
  and left it to rot.<br/>
  That was you.<br/>
  They tried to murder him first.<br/>
 Aw, geez.<br/>
  Well,
 you'll be happy to know
  that the council's
 gone now
  Yeah, he knows.<br/>
 He murdered them.<br/>
  You want to rein in your Morty?
 Every day.<br/>
  The Citadel of Ricks
 Redevelopment Fund
  donates Morty, he's not
 gonna donate.<br/>
  You're pitching
 the Policeman's Ball
  to a black teenager here.<br/>
  Let's go.<br/> You don't
 have to be a dick.<br/>
  I think you know that's not true.<br/>
 Geez.<br/>
  I didn't know there were
 still Ricks and Mortys
  living on the Citadel.<br/>
  I wonder what their
 day-to-day lives are like.<br/>
  Well, you can keep
 wondering that
  while we go
 on a fun, fresh,
  self-contained adventure
 to Atlantis.<br/>
  Anyone continuing to explore
 the Citadel is either stupid
  or one of
 the unfortunate millions
  held hostage
 by their terrible ideas.<br/>
  Man, I'm glad
 I'm not one of them!
  Announcer Rick:
 Citadel Morning News.<br/>
  News about the Citadel
 in the morning,
  pretty self explanatory.<br/>
  Good morning.<br/>
 I'm Rick D-716B.<br/>
  And I'm Rick D-716.<br/>
 Must be nice.<br/>
  Coming up, gravity outages
 in East Sanchez Heights
  And, is your uranium-powered
 cellular matrix
  making you sick?
  The answer
 may not surprise you.<br/>
  It's
 Yes, it's uranium.<br/>
  Those stories and more,
 after this break.<br/>
  Sam Elliot: 60 iterations
 off the central finite curve,
  there's a Rick
 that works more with wood
  than polarity plating.<br/>
  His name is Simple Rick
 but he's no dummy.<br/>
  He realized long ago
  that the greatest thing
 he'd ever create
  was his daughter.<br/>
  I love Daddy!
  Sam Elliot:
 We captured that moment
  We run it on a loop
 through Simple Rick's mind
  And the chemical
 it makes his brain secrete
  goes into every Simple Rick's
 ""Simple Wafers"" Wafer Cookie.<br/>
  Come home to
 the impossible flavor
  of your own completion.<br/>
  Come home to Simple Rick's.<br/>
  Just one day remains
  before our
 newly democratic Citadel
  elects its first President,
  it's anyone's race
 among the Rick candidates.<br/>
  But a certain
 other candidate
  should be getting
 at least one vote
  for most adorable.<br/>
  That's right.<br/>
  The Morty party candidate's
 still in the race,
  and you just gotta
 love him for that.<br/>
  Here you see him in his little
 Morty suit waving
  Isn't that adorable?
 Little jackass.<br/>
  Yeah,
 I think we actually have
  the audio
 for his speech here
  Aw, geez.<br/> Aw, man.<br/>
  I'm gonna lose the election
 and stuff.<br/>
  We had a good run, sir,
  but I think it's time
 to pull out of the race.<br/>
  I feel pretty confident
 about tonight's debate.<br/>
  You shouldn't, sir.<br/>
 You should be terrified.<br/>
  Maybe you should find
 a little faith, young man.<br/>
  You don't pay me
 to have faith.<br/>
  And we're the same age!
  - Aah!
 - Whoa!
  Sorry.<br/>
 I-I was expecting
  A Rick partner?
  Lesson one, rookie,
 expect the unexpected.<br/>
  Now, get in.<br/>
  Mortys are human!
  Get the [Bleep.]<br/> off the car,
 you Rickless [Bleep.]<br/> animal!
  Whoa! Morty Cop: The election's
 got these yellow shirts
  more riled up than
 a picture-day Jessica.<br/>
  That's pretty harsh, sir.<br/>
  So report me.<br/>
 Nobody gives a [Bleep.]<br/>
  Look, I'm just saying,
 it makes me a little sad
  to hear a Morty cop
 calling Mortys animals.<br/>
  Well, it makes me sad to hear
 another Rick cop
  buying into his
 sensitivity training.<br/>
  Well, I'm glad to know
 there's more like me.<br/>
  There was one.<br/>
  Why do you think that seat was empty?
  Rick Dispatch: Robbery at Fifth
 and Avenue.<br/>
  Fifth and
  That's Morty Town.<br/>
 Unit seven responding.<br/>
  Rick Teacher:
 Good idea, Rick.<br/>
  All Morty Students:
 Good idea, Rick.<br/>
  This is a great adventure.<br/>
  All:
 This is a great adventure.<br/>
  I love being
 your new Morty.<br/>
  All: I love being
 your new Mor Farty.<br/>
  Very amusing, Mr.<br/> Smith.<br/>
  Almost as amusing as
 when your first Rick
  was decapitated on
 Zorpantheon Nine.<br/>
  Or was that
 your third Rick?
  How many Ricks
 have you had?
  Five.<br/> I see.<br/>
  So you are top of the class
 in something.<br/>
  Tomorrow you'll be
 transferred to your new Ricks.<br/>
  Hopefully
 they will be your last.<br/>
  Yes, Slow Ri
 Tall Morty?
  Di did I gradgitate
 this time yet?
  Anything's possible,
 Tall Morty.<br/>
  I guess we won't be seeing
 each other after this?
  I say we make
 our last day count.<br/>
  I say we go to
 the Wishing Portal.<br/>
  That's a myth.<br/>
 It's not a myth.<br/>
  My first Rick's fourth Morty
  knew a Rick
 whose Morty went there.<br/>
  If we're not here
 for graduation,
  our butts are gonna wind up
 in Morty Town.<br/>
  I thought your last Rick
 fused you with a lizard,
  not a chicken.<br/>
  Okay, fine.<br/> I'm in.<br/>
  Me too.<br/>
  What the hell?!
 I thought I saw a fly.<br/>
  Supervisor Rick:
  Listen up, [Bleep.]<br/> nuts.<br/>
  I've been your supervisor
 for five years,
  but all shitty things
 must come to an end
  and I have been promoted
 to regional manager.<br/>
  All:
  Yeah, I feel the same way,
 may be never meet again.<br/>
  Of course,
  that makes the position
 of supervisor available,
  so, as of next week,
 the ass you'll be kissing
  will be that of
  K-83, affectionately
 known as Cool Rick.<br/>
  All:
  I know
 I'm new to the Citadel,
  and some of you might not think
 I put in my time,
  but what can I say?
  I'm Cool Rick!
  Yo! Ha! Ha!
 Check me out!
  All right knuckleheads,
 any questions?
  All right, then, back to work,
 you gold rickers.<br/>
  No Ricks, no families,
  high off their asses,
 and running amuck.<br/>
  Mortys are raised
 to be sidekicks.<br/>
  Without a side to kick,
 they just start kicking.<br/>
  They were
 They were about my height,
  around 14 years old
  their their shirts
 were yellow!
  Yeah, make sure
 you get that down.<br/>
  Any mutations,
 augmentations?
  Three eyes? A tail?
 Maybe a buzz cut?
  No.<br/>
 Just four normal Mortys.<br/>
  Normal?
 Put it in your blog.<br/>
  Let me turn over
 a few rocks.<br/>
  Aw, geez.<br/>
 Hey, what's goin' on, fellas?
  Aw, geez, man.<br/>
 Nothing, man.<br/>
  We're just hanging out
 and stuff.<br/>
  I hear that.<br/> Aw, geez.<br/>
  I guess I'm supposed to be
 figurin' out
  who robbed the store
 across the street.<br/>
  But, aw, geez,
 I don't know.<br/>
  Aw, geez man, that sucks
  that your Rick's
 making you do that.<br/>
  He's not my Rick.<br/>
 He's my partner.<br/>
  Aw, geez.<br/>
  Well, maybe the uniform
 makes a big difference,
  who am I to say.<br/>
  To me, you just look
 like a sidekick.<br/>
  Whoa! Call me a
 sidekick one more time!
  Call me a sidekick!
  Hey, man! Come on!
 Aw, geez!
  Wanna see
 how I paint a wall?!
  It was
 the Morty Town Locos, man!
  The the Morty Town Locos!
  Aah! Aah!
  Do you realize how many codes
 you just violated?
  Aw, geez, Rick.<br/>
  What do I know about
 knowin' stuff?
  Get in the [Bleep.]<br/> car.<br/>
  More lasers.<br/>
  You could take more time
  to answer the question
 if you like.<br/>
  Okay, Juggling Rick,
  how would you solve
 the Citadel's financial crisis?
  First off,
 can I just say
  that I believe this Citadel
 is the greatest
  in the entire multi-verse.<br/>
  Now, I believe
 the answer to your question
  has three parts.<br/>
  First, education spending
 must get much higher
  But it has to be balanced
 with defense
  Whoa! Whoa! Can we fact
 check this please?
  Never mind.<br/>
 Who am I kidding.<br/>
  This race is over.<br/>
  And that's how you run
 a Citadel!
  Candidate Morty,
  the number of displaced Mortys
 is soaring
  while Rick satisfaction levels
 are plummeting,
  and the divide
 between the two groups
  has never been wider.<br/>
  Solve that one real quick.<br/>
  I don't see a divide
 between Ricks and Mortys
  Shocker.<br/>
  I'd like to offer
 a re-buttal.<br/>
  Gentlemen, gentlemen,
  I think we can all agree
 on one thing
  Well, it came out
 as two things
  but you get the idea.<br/>
  You guys finished?
  The division I see
  is between
 the Ricks and Mortys
  that like
 the Citadel divided
  and the rest of us.<br/>
  I see it everywhere I go.<br/>
  I see it in our schools
  where they teach Mortys
 we're all the same,
  because they're threatened by
 what makes us unique.<br/>
  I see it in our streets
  where they give guns
 to Mortys,
  so we're too busy
 fighting each other
  to fight real injustice.<br/>
  I see it in our factories
  where Ricks work for a fraction
 of their boss' salary
  even though they're identical
 and have the same IQ.<br/>
  The Citadel's problem
 isn't homeless Mortys
  or outraged Ricks.<br/>
  The Citadel's problem
 is the Ricks and Mortys
  feeding on
 the Citadel's death
  Holy [Bleep.]<br/>
  Rick Security Officer:
 He's headed for the flavor core!
  But I've got
 a message for them,
  from the Ricks and Mortys
 keeping it alive,
  a message
 from the Ricks and Mortys
  that believe in this Citadel
  to the Ricks and Mortys
 that don't.<br/>
  You're outnumbered.<br/>
  Holy [Bleep.]<br/>
  I don't believe it.<br/>
  I-I can't believe it.<br/>
  I know.<br/>
 That's why you're fired.<br/>
  Sounds like
 you're looking for work.<br/>
  I can offer you
  a very enticing
 compensation package.<br/>
  First,
 let's talk benefits
  Daddy loves you.<br/>
 That's Daddy's good girl.<br/>
  Your life is a lie, man.<br/>
  All your life's are lies!
  Don't you get it?!
  They told us we were special
 because we were Ricks,
  but they stripped us of
 everything that made us unique!
  We know how you feel.<br/>
  We're working-stiff Ricks
 just like you.<br/>
  But our assembly line
 is justice.<br/>
  What are your demands?
  I-I-I want a portal gun.<br/>
  Unregistered, untraceable,
  with enough fluid to take me off
 this God damn prison!
  The media's outside.<br/>
 Well, keep 'em there.<br/>
  Anyway, so yeah, the suspect
 says the Citadel's a lie,
  built on lies,
 and some other shit.<br/>
  I say appreciate
 the life you have,
  because it can always
 be worse.<br/>
  Back to you, Ricks.<br/>
  Thank you, Rick 0716-C.<br/>
  That [Bleep.]<br/> guy.<br/>
 Tell me about it.<br/>
  Meanwhile,
 in election news,
  an unexpected turn of events
  as Morty
 from the Morty Party
  soars to
 the top of the polls.<br/>
  Yes.<br/>
  Morty, what's your original
 reality and where's your Rick?
  Gosh, we moved around so much
 it's hard to remember.<br/>
  I see every Rick
 as my Rick,
  I hope they see me as their Morty.<br/>
  Another? Please?
 With less water?
  Hey, cheer up, pal.<br/>
  A Morty's
 gonna be president.<br/>
  Imagine this kisser
  getting blamed
 for everything.<br/>
  I guess I should've had
 more faith.<br/>
  It's not faith you need.<br/>
 It's fear.<br/>
  What's this?
  It's secrets.<br/>
  Wh wh wh
 What do you think it is?
  Look at how I'm dressed.<br/>
  Rick Reporter: Having taken aim
 at the system,
  are afraid at all
 for your safety?
  Candidate Morty: I'd rather
 live in hope than fear.<br/>
  If I had to fear anything,
  I'd fear other people
 being afraid.<br/>
  Of fear.<br/> Itself.<br/>
  But.<br/> No, I'm not afraid.<br/>
  you gonna lick my balls
 or what?
  Sheeeet, grandson,
  you keep me peelin' skrabquams
 and slippin' nib nibs,
  I'll lick whatever
 ain't nailed down.<br/>
  Hands in the air!
  What the hell, man?!
 What the hellin' hell?
  You guys doing a little
 chemistry homework
  with Grandpa? Is this
 what I think it is?
  Bootleg portal fluid.<br/>
  I guess his math was off.<br/>
  Search the place.<br/>
  Are are you
 my new R Rick?
  It's okay, Morty.<br/>
  Jesus.<br/>
  He stabbed me.<br/>
 He got me bad, Morty.<br/>
  Shh.<br/> It's okay.<br/>
 You're okay.<br/>
  You were right.<br/>
  Everything I learned at the
 academy was Doesn't matter.<br/>
  Nothing's wrong with putting
 your faith in a Morty.<br/>
  You just gotta pick
 the right one.<br/>
  Why is there a crib
 in here?
  Something they do.<br/>
 To make you feel bad.<br/>
  Boy, I got us knee-deep
 in paperwork?
  Go to the car
 and grab a medi-pack.<br/>
  Let me worry about this.<br/>
  What happened?
 Same old story
  Mortys killing Mortys.<br/>
  Almost got it
  Farmer Rick: Hey!
  Y'all get the hell away
 from my damn mega fruit!
  Sic 'em, boy!
  I don't wear
 this dag-nab hat
  and commit
 to this rural character
  so you can eat for free
 while you come of age!
  I bet the Wishing Portal
 leads to a reality
  where they're
 Where all
  Where it's a bunch of
 French toast with boobies.<br/>
  I bet it leads to a place
 with a bunch of fry
  Fly flies everywhere.<br/>
  Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere.<br/>
  I bet it's a big hole
  where the Citadel dumps
 all its broken dreams.<br/>
  Slick, why do you have to be
 so dramatic?
  You wanna know why?
 Because of this.<br/>
  I'm part of
 an experimental line of Mortys
  with a drama implant.<br/>
  How do you think it feels,
 Fat Morty,
  to know that
 no matter where I go,
  I'll always be the one
  that makes everybody sad
 and a little bored.<br/>
  Slick, that implant
 isn't who you are, okay?
  You also
 roll up your sleeves.<br/>
  I thought
 I was Left-Handed Morty.<br/>
  Then you should
 use your left hand
  to eat more vegetables.<br/>
  Hey, there.<br/> How you doing?
 Great to meet you.<br/>
  I'm a plumber, sir.<br/>
  I'm a Rick,
 and I'm a plumber.<br/>
  That doesn't sound like
 Rick work.<br/>
  You didn't come to the Citadel
 to be a plumber, did you?
  Ha! Ha!
 I sure didn't, sir!
  Mr.<br/> Morty! Mr.<br/> Morty!
  I cloned myself so you could
 kiss me as a baby!
  This is just like
 a Morty baby!
  Hey, did you, 
 end up getting a new job?
  Yeah, I did.<br/>
  Assassinating you.<br/>
  I'm okay
  I'm okay
  I'm
  Aw, man.<br/> Aw, geez.<br/>
  Aw, hah.<br/>
  You look like you could use
 a good time.<br/>
  One dance for $10,
 two for $25.<br/>
  No, thank you
 And bad math.<br/>
  Ha! Ha! Yeah!
 This is a good time!
  What is this place?
 The Creepy Morty.<br/>
  What is it your kind's
 always saying
  ""Don't think about it.<br/>""
  Come on.<br/>
  There's someone important
 I want you to meet.<br/>
  Bubbala!
  How'd it go with
 the Morty Town Locos?
  They had
 a little accident.<br/>
  They won't be causing
 any trouble anymore.<br/>
  Those were bad Mortys.<br/>
 Very bad Mortys.<br/>
  Big Morty
 likes to contribute
  to keeping the peace
 in Morty Town.<br/>
  Think of him
 as a ""drug lord""
  and us as
 cops on his payroll.<br/>
  Morty
  - Which Morty?
 - Which Morty?
  M m my partner.<br/>
  Morty, you're right.<br/>
 Morty Town is bad.<br/>
  But that doesn't mean
 that we have to be.<br/>
  Hey, what's going on here,
 Morty?
  - Which Morty?
 - Which Morty?
  The cop, morons!
  Don't worry about Rick,
 Big Morty.<br/>
  He's new.<br/>
  He doesn't understand
 how it works.<br/>
  That's what you said
 about your last partner.<br/>
  Why would you say something
 like that, Big Morty?
  You're [Bleep.]<br/> things up for
 both of us here.<br/> Wrong.<br/>
  He's [Bleep.]<br/> things up
 for both of you.<br/>
  Unless he takes
 the money.<br/>
  Big Morty,
 you're under arrest.<br/>
  S smartest man
 in the universe.<br/>
  They're just props!
 Th they're just props!
  Not so
 big now, are ya?
  I never was!
 It was figurative!
  That's enough.<br/> If we don't
 kill him, he'll talk.<br/>
  If you do, I'll talk.<br/>
  Cowboy Morty:
 O one thing's for sure,
  Y y'all don't have to worry
 about Cowboy Morty talkin'.<br/>
  This little cowpoke's gonna
 mosey up on out of here.<br/>
  You told me to put my faith
 in the right Morty.<br/>
  I've got faith in you,
 partner.<br/>
  Do the right thing.<br/>
  Grandpa Rick,
  I-I don't wanna be
 on the Citadel anymore.<br/>
  I wanna be a regular kid.<br/>
  I-I wanna to go to school
 and throw balls around
  and masturbate.<br/>
  What the hell happened
 in there?
  Same old story.<br/>
  Ricks killing Mortys.<br/>
  Okay, man, okay,
 we got your portal gun.<br/>
  What the hell's
 he doing?
  Where where am I?
 A bad place.<br/>
  But you're going
 to a better one soon.<br/>
  Hey! Hey!
  No, no, no, no
  Whaa
  God damn it!
  A portal to
 the blender dimension?
  That's the oldest trick
 in the book!
  I'm a Rick!
 I'm more Rick than any of you!
  Then you should know you just
 killed your only leverage!
  Then comes and get me,
 mother[Bleep.]<br/>
  Stop.<br/>
 I'm Rick D.<br/> Sanchez the Third,
  owner of this here
 wafer establishment,
  and I say that the Rick in there
 is right.<br/>
  He's more Rick
 than any of you.<br/>
  He's a terrorist!
  What Rick isn't?!
  This Citadel
 was founded by Ricks
  for Ricks to be free!
  What's your name,
 young man?
  Rick.<br/> And I'm The
 same age as me, I know.<br/>
  How long have you worked here?
 15 years.<br/>
  What the hell
 have we become?
  Whatever time
 you were gonna make him serve,
  he's served it.<br/>
  It ends now.<br/>
  Come with me, friend.<br/>
 Where are we going?
  To your new life.<br/>
  Which starts with walking
 the [Bleep.]<br/> out of here.<br/>
  Yo J-22, give 'em hell!
  Sam Elliot: There's a Rick
 that held a factory hostage
  after murdering his boss
 and several coworkers.<br/>
  The factory made cookies,
 flavored them with lies.<br/>
  He made us all take a look
 at what we were doing.<br/>
  And in the bargain,
 he got a taste of real freedom.<br/>
  We captured that taste,
  and we keep giving it to him
  so he give it
 right back to you,
  in every bite of new.<br/>
  Simple Rick
 Freedom Wafer Selects.<br/>
  Come home to the unique flavor
  of shattering
 the grand illusion.<br/>
  Come home to Simple Rick.<br/>
  It is real.<br/>
  After you.<br/>
  Specs: There it is.<br/>
 The Wishing Portal.<br/>
  They say for your wish
 to come true,
  you have to give up something
 really important.<br/>
  For me,
 that's my panini maker.<br/>
  I wish for
 a million sandwiches.<br/>
  And, yes,
 I see the irony.<br/>
  I guess
 I wish I had something cooler
  than this dumb-ass
 surfer necklace.<br/>
  I wish incest porn had
  Had a more mainstream
 appeal.<br/>
  For
 For a friend of mine.<br/>
  None of those things
 are gonna happen, you know.<br/>
  Morty wishes
 never come true.<br/>
  Not on the Citadel.<br/>
  Then why did you
 bring us here?
  Because I wish
 that would change.<br/>
  I wish anything about this life
 would change.<br/>
  Well, I hope you're
 putting something
  pretty God damn important
 in there.<br/>
  Me too.<br/>
  But I doubt it.<br/>
  - No!
 - Slick!
  M maybe
  maybe it went
 somewhere nice.<br/>
  Automated Rick:
 Garbage dump.<br/>
  Stand back.<br/>
  He had to be stopped.<br/>
  He he cou he c
 Couldn't be allowed to win.<br/>
  Then you should've
 worked on your aim, bro.<br/>
  He's alive? No, no, no.<br/>
 You gotta listen to me.<br/>
  I-I worked for him.<br/>
  I was his campaign manager.<br/>
  That Morty
 is not what he seems.<br/>
  Yeah, well, no Morty
 seems like a president.<br/>
  He won? Yeah.<br/>
  It was a blow out.<br/>
  I would hardly call it
 a blow out.<br/>
  It was almost close enough
 to trigger a recount.<br/>
  Jesus.<br/> What are you
 joke security now too?
  Rick Cop:
 Why am I still here?
  I heard he confessed
 to everything.<br/>
  Your case has been reviewed.<br/>
 You're free to go.<br/>
  But I violated at least
 a dozen departmental codes.<br/>
  New department.<br/>
 New codes.<br/>
  New Citadel.<br/>
  Specs:
 Did we miss graduation?
  Where are the new Ricks?
  No graduation.<br/>
 No new Ricks.<br/>
  The school's curriculum is changing.<br/>
 To what?
  I don't know,
 and I don't have to know.<br/>
  I've been fired.<br/>
  Good luck, turds.<br/>
  Holy crap.<br/>
 Slick's wish came true.<br/>
  Sorry I'm late,
 Mr.<br/> President.<br/>
  Had a little crisis at work.<br/>
 Worth it!
  It's no problem.<br/>
  A little more
 off the top.<br/>
  You were saying,
 Garment District Rick.<br/>
  We were saying,
 ""President"" Morty,
  that we don't care
 who sits in that seat.<br/>
  A Rick, a Morty,
 a god damn Jerry
  It doesn't matter.<br/>
  We've been running the Citadel
 since before the council
  and you'll find that we're
 still running it now.<br/>
  Does he really speak
 for everyone here?
  Yeah.<br/>
  Well, I think it's important
 to be clear.<br/>
  Raise your hand
 if he speaks for you.<br/>
  Is that enough
 off the top?
  I don't know.<br/> Is it?
  - Yes, yes, god damn, yes.<br/>
 - I think it's great.<br/>
  Good.<br/>
  This seems like
 a good time for a drink
  and a cold calculated speech
 with sinister overtones.<br/>
  A speech about politics
  About order
  Brotherhood
  Power.<br/>
  But speeches
 are for campaigning.<br/>
  Now is the time for action.<br/>
  Whoo! Yeah!
  Atlantis, baby!
 That was amazing.<br/>
  You got some of that
 mermaid puss.<br/>
  I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off
 thing and I can see her again.<br/>
  By the way, hey, um,
  you're still not
 curious about what
  what might've happened
 at that crazy Citadel place?
  Psh.<br/> Not at all, Morty.<br/>
  That place will never have
  any bearing over our lives
 ever again.<br/>
  Unlike that mermaid puss!
 Whoo!
  Yeah! We're going back for seconds!
 Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!
  We're gonna do that shit
 every week, man!
  That was Atlantis!
 Shit!

<|endoftext|>

Morty, hurry!
  Return the Truth Tortoise!
  Morty, whatever you do,
 don't drop the Truth Tortoise!
  Also really important,
  whatever you do,
 don't look into its eyes!
  I I did look at it, Rick!
 I've been looking at it!
  Now you're gonna know
 everything, Morty!
  Good job! Way to go!
 You [BLEEP.]<br/> everything up!
  It's in my head!
  Ah!
  Oh, geez, I I can't get that
 Truth Tortoise out of my head.<br/>
  Yeah, I told you not
 to look into its eyes.<br/>
  Hey, Morty, let's watch some
 interdimensional cable.<br/>
  Remember how we used to do that?
  Rick, I can't
 I can't go on.<br/>
  I-I can't go on like this with the
 Truth Tortoise shit in my head.<br/>
  I-I wish you could just
  Erase the memory from your mind?
  How did you know
 I was gonna say that?
  Come on, Morty, come with me.<br/>
  After you.<br/>
  What the hell is this?!
  This, Morty, is my archive
  of all the experiences
 you've begged me to remove
  from your life,
 lest you go insane.<br/>
  I call them
 Morty's Mind Blowers.<br/>
  And we'll be doing this instead
 of interdimensional cable.<br/>
  How long have I been asking you
 to remove memories?
  Since the first time
 your mind was blown.<br/>
  Ahh, here it is.<br/>
  Classic.<br/>
  There's no dust on it because
  this isn't the first time
 we've done this.<br/>
  - What?!
 - I call this one ""Moonspiracy""!
  Huh, wow.<br/>
 That's incredible.<br/>
  What the heck?
  Morty, do you realize how
 ridiculous that sounds?
  Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty.<br/>
  Are you serious?
  Half the crap we've seen,
 and you think that sounds crazy?
  I've been to 300 versions
 of Earth's moon,
  including this one,
 and I've never seen signs
  of a ""regular dude,""
 as you describe him,
  hanging out up there.<br/>
  It's probably just
 a smudge on the lens.<br/>
  Smudge on the lens?
 Smudge on the lens?!
  I know the difference between
 a man threatening me
  and a smudge on
 the goddamn lens, Summer!
  Morty, calm down!
 Are you feeling okay?
  I'm fine!
  So sensitive.<br/>
  Kids,
 I'd like to introduce you all
  to our new guidance counselor,
 Mr.<br/> Lunas.<br/>
  I look forward
 to helping guide you all
  towards a brighter future.<br/>
  I believe every
 student should
  shoot for the moon.<br/>
  Got you now, you son of a bitch.<br/>
  What's this?
  Proof that Mr.<br/> Lunas
 isn't who he says he is!
  He's not a guidance counselor?
  I I assume he's qualified
 to be one, who isn't?
  But he also lives on the moon.<br/>
  Okay.<br/>
  Hmm.<br/>
  Is that it?
  Is he doing anything
 to hurt anyone?
  Oh, he's up to something.<br/>
  I think I understand.<br/>
  ""Up to something,""
 ""lives on the moon.<br/>""
  Okay, I'll talk to him.<br/>
  What did he say?
  Denied the moon stuff,
 but that's what pedophiles do,
  they deny,
 it's their bread and butter.<br/>
  Pedophile?
 You don't think so?
  I thought the moon thing
 might have been code.<br/>
  No, he's literally
 from the moon!
  Well, you saw him react.<br/>
  Moon or not,
 that dude likes 'em young.<br/>
  Gordon Lunas was a good Marine.<br/>
  We don't know what drove
 him to take his own life,
  but we want to remember
 the good things.<br/>
  Like how, from a certain angle,
  some people would say
 he looked like a smudge.<br/>
  Oh, my God, what have I done?
  What have I done?
  Jesus, I made that guy
 kill himself!
  Only in a literal sense.<br/>
  Here's one I call
 ""Morty's Menagerie.<br/>""
  They don't all
 have titles, though.<br/>
  It's not a ""Simpsons""
 Halloween special,
  more like a clip show made
 of clips you never saw!
  I can't believe we got
 put into a menagerie.<br/>
  So this guy collects
 living beings?
  Yeah, you know like
 commemorative plates,
  but less off-putting.<br/>
  You'll get it when you're still
 actively dating in your 40s.<br/>
  Assess this with
 cold indifference,
  you beany-headed prick!
  Hey, keep it down!
  Just our luck, menagerie beneath
  the ""boulder people""
 of Granitor Seven.<br/>
  I can't take it anymore, Rick!
  Relax, Morty!
  I can't relax! R-R-Rick, we
 We gotta get outta here!
  I don't care what it takes!
 Anything!
  - Anything?
 - Anything!
  All right, well, you're gonna
 have to take off your shirt.<br/>
  Not yet.<br/>
 I'll tell you when.<br/>
  Dear God.<br/>
  What?
  The signal
 turned out to be
  There's no other way
 to put it
  Instructions.<br/>
 For?
  A vehicle, sir,
 an interstellar vehicle.<br/>
  We'll need a pilot.<br/>
 I wonder if there's a volunteer.<br/>
  Mm.<br/>
  Oh, the schematics specify
 a second, smaller pilot.<br/>
  I mean, they really
 specify smaller.<br/>
  They have to be exactly 5'3"".<br/>
  Chang, you may have majored
 in Liberal Arts,
  but I think you're about
 to make history.<br/>
  Primary systems, check.<br/>
  Auxiliary systems, check.<br/>
  See you soon.<br/>
  Okay, now.<br/>
  Greetings.<br/>
  You're
 You look
  We've possessed forms
 your mind can accept.<br/>
  Here are some customary
 clothing gifts.<br/>
  Please, put them on.<br/>
  - May we?
 - Of course, yes.<br/>
  We followed your instructions.<br/>
  We have so much
 to learn from you.<br/>
  I know, right?
  Hey, how come I was able to see
 those other people's memories?
  I I wouldn't have been
 around for that.<br/>
  Yeah, sometimes I gotta do
 a little editing, Morty.<br/>
  It helps the mind blowers
  play a little bit better
 upon revisiting.<br/>
  I call this one
 ""The Whole Enchilada.<br/>""
  Here, Morty, this'll make
 your urine drinkable.<br/>
  Now can we keep shopping?
  I am Zikzak.<br/>
  Ah, shit, Morty, get behind me.<br/>
 It's a [BLEEP.]<br/> alien overlord!
  It's okay.<br/>
 Here.<br/>
  Oh, I misjudged.<br/>
  ""I am Floop Floopian.<br/>
 Please kill me.<br/>""
  That's right, Morty.<br/>
  The Floop Floopians achieve
 an eternal orgasmic afterlife,
  so long as they're killed
 by a great warrior.<br/>
  I'm flattered, by the way.<br/>
 Thank you very much.<br/>
  So you're gonna kill him?
  Eh, let's get some lunch first.<br/>
  So, you want to get shot
 in the head, or
  Well, as long as
 the wound is fatal,
  I don't really mind
 where you shoot me.<br/>
  Cool.<br/>
 I'm gonna go take a quick shit.<br/>
  Well, I gotta say.<br/>
 You know, I'm a little envious.<br/>
  Your species has
 an actual afterlife.<br/>
  That's gotta be nice.<br/>
  Wh-What do you mean?
  Well, you know, here on Earth,
 w-we don't know what's going on.<br/>
  It must be nice for you guys to,
 you know, have that
  Have that proof's in
 the pudding, you know, evidence.<br/>
  Evidence?
 There's supposed to be evidence?
  Um, yeah, uh
  otherwise,
 how do you know if it's true?
  Wait, you don't
  All right, so you want to do
 this here or outside?
  Run!
  I don't wanna die!
  Oh, God, it's all real!
 Oh, it hurts!
  Oh, I shouldn't have doubted it!
  I shouldn't have let
 you make me doubt it!
  Aah!
 I blame you, I blame you!
  But he said there
 wasn't any evidence!
  That was a ton of evidence!
  Well, silver lining.<br/>
  Now I know their
 religion's real.<br/>
  They have a hell,
 and it does not look good.<br/>
  I noticed you never finished
 your chimichanga,
  so I got some room for it now,
 if you know what I mean.<br/>
  Holy [BLEEP.]<br/>!
  How many of these are just
 horrible mistakes I've made?
  I mean, maybe
 I'd stop making so many
  if I let myself learn from them!
  Don't break your back
 creating a lesson, Morty.<br/>
  It's a freeform anthology.<br/>
  I'm getting annoyed
 you're not hearing that.<br/>
  As you can see around me,
 your mind's been blown
  countless times,
 and not always by yourself.<br/>
  Ah, [BLEEP.]<br/>,
 I don't even
  This better not
 have been a good one.<br/>
  What is this?
  Great, ""Booger AIDS,""
 ""AIDS Booger.<br/>""
  I gotta start using
 real file names.<br/>
  In the meantime,
 enjoy a grab bag
  of mind blowers I call
 ""Poop AIDS underscore copy.<br/>""
  I'm not
 an unreasonable man, Beth Smith.<br/>
  I know children are everything
 to a mammal.<br/>
  I will spare one of their lives.<br/>
  You simply have to choose.<br/>
  Summer!
 Summer.<br/>
  You're not gonna believe this.<br/>
  I went to Phoebe
 instead of Titan.<br/>
  It's, like, hello, Saturn,
 after ten moons,
  time to stop naming and start
 numbering, you know?
  What's Wh-What's with you
 assholes?
  Morty, please, don't do this.<br/>
  Your Morty is gone!
  I am Voltamatron,
 Destroyer of Worlds!
  Grandpa Rick, there must be some
 scientific way to save him!
  Not scientific,
 but there may be a way.<br/>
  Morty, I know you're in there.<br/>
 It's me, your grandpa.<br/>
  I know I can be mean,
 but I love you, Morty.<br/>
  We all do,
 you gotta fight this thing.<br/>
  I know you can.<br/>
 You're stronger than all of us!
  Morty, it's mom! We love you,
 you have to fight it!
  Come on, Morty!
 Fight that stupid worm thing!
  We love you!
  We love you so much!
  Yes, Morty, come on,
 you're doing it!
  You're doing it!
 You're doing it!
  Should we pull it out?
  No, don't touch it.<br/>
 Just keep loving Morty!
  We still love you.<br/>
  But I do have
 a thing at 6:00.<br/>
  Oh, God, do I have
 to keep looking?
  Geez, Morty, come on,
 pinch it off already!
  Don't! Oh, God, sorry, Morty,
 I love you!
  God, is there going
 to be an intermission?
  Excuse me, but I ordered
 the large evil space worm.<br/>
  I know, it's like,
 is that a demon slug
  in your stomach,
 or are you just happy to
  Sorry!
  Well, I guess it's nice to know
 the whole family sucks!
  So if the blues ones
 are my fault,
  and the purple ones are my
 family's, what are the red ones?
  Yeah, d-don't read
 into it, Morty!
  Ahh.<br/>
  [BLEEP.]<br/> We need to find shelter
 before the sunset, Morty.<br/>
  Venzenulon Nine has a night
 temperature of 300 below!
  We'll freeze, Morty!
 W-We'll be dead in seconds!
  I I think I saw
 a cave over there.<br/>
  You've seen
 too many movies, Morty.<br/>
  A cave isn't gonna cut it.<br/>
 We're gonna have to use Beebo.<br/>
  Beebo led us to water!
 He's our friend!
  - He won't even feel it!
 - Oh, no, no!
  You wanna die, Morty?
 Get in Beebo!
  Oh, no, no!
  Brace for the ice limit.<br/>
  Here it comes!
  Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine
 or Venzenulon Seven?
  Wait a minute, why would I ask
 for that to be removed?
  Are the red ones stuff
 you wanted removed?
  Ooh, that's clever, Morty, but I
 don't use color to sort things
  because I'm not a mouse in
 a European children's book.<br/>
  Then why are all those
 pink ones by the liquor?
  Liquor?
  [Bleep.]<br/>, that was close.<br/>
 We lost Captain Sky.<br/>
  He gave his life
 for the uprising.<br/>
  Yeah.<br/> It really makes
 you think, huh, Morty?
  We should never take
 things for granite.<br/>
  - What?
 - I'm just saying, life's short.<br/>
  We shouldn't take things
 for granite.<br/>
  - Are you saying ""granite""?
 - Well, yeah.<br/>
  It's ""granted,""
 with a ""D.<br/>""
  Take things for granted.<br/>
 Did you actually think it was
  Jesus Christ, Rick,
  what are you, a boulder
 A rock person?
  How long have you been saying
 that wrong?
  Oh, you like that, huh?
  I b-b-bet that really
 blows your mind.<br/>
  I mean, yeah,
 it's kind of great.<br/>
  - You want me to erase it?
 - What, you can do that?
  Ah, [BLEEP.]<br/>.<br/>
  I [BLEEP.]<br/> knew it,
 you piece of [BLEEP.]<br/>!
  You You
 You're a [BLEEP.]<br/> asshole, Rick!
  Take it easy, Morty, come on.<br/>
 Just relax.<br/>
  No, I'm not gonna [BLEEP.]<br/> relax!
 Come here!
  Let go of me, you little bitch!
  I'm gonna grab you by the
 scruff of your Take that!
  Ohh!
  - Umm.<br/>
 - Umm.<br/> Uhh.<br/>
  - What
 - What's going on?
  - Where am I?
 - Who are we?
  Who am I?
  I think I'm an adolescent boy.<br/>
  Huh, and I'm an elderly man.<br/>
  And we appear to be in some kind
 of secret confined space.<br/>
  Yeah, umm
  Don't look at me like that.<br/>
  For all we know, you could be
 the [BLEEP.]<br/> weirdo.<br/>
  Huh, these things are
 obviously storage units,
  and since we can't remember
 what went wrong,
  my guess is that the technology
 involves memory,
  and that this thing on your head
 is designed to
  Tell us the code, jagoff!
  It's pointless.<br/>
 He's stonewalling.<br/>
  Rick, if we don't unlock those
 vaccines, Earth dies!
  You know, it might be time to
 step up your interrogation!
  Not sure what
 you're implying, Morty,
  but some lines I don't cross.<br/>
  Yeah, well,
 I crossed every line I had
  when this bastard
 tried to kill Jessica!
  Okay, see those two fleshy sacs
 under his chin, Morty?
  Grab 'em.<br/>
  You remember the codes now?
  Twist!
  Give us the codes, man!
 Twist harder, Morty!
  Harder!
  Okay, let go, let go,
 let him breathe.<br/>
  He wants to make a deal.<br/>
  Half the codes now,
 half after you finish.<br/>
  But can we trust
 Wait, what?
  F-Finish what?
  Y-You know
  I thought I was torturing him!
  Oh, and this disappoints you?
  Do I tell him we don't
 have a deal, Morty?
  Because if we can
 kill our enemies,
  but we can't jack them off, then
 how are we better than them?
  Well, what did you find out?
  We're partners, I guess,
  and we fight aliens,
 like ""Men in Black""?
  ""Men in Black,""
 ""Men in Black.<br/>""
  I have ""Men in Black 2"" in here.<br/>
  So So you get
 the general idea.<br/>
  Not quite.<br/>
  It's basically an endless string
 of callbacks to
  All right, save it for Youtube.<br/>
 I'll keep looking for clues.<br/>
  What are you doing?
  You want your shelf
 level or not?
  And if I say yes, you're gonna
 provide that for me with that?
  Yes, see the bubble?
  I'm familiar with
 the bubble, Morty.<br/>
  I also dabble in precision,
  and if you think
 you can even approach it
  with your sad, naked,
 caveman eyeball
  and a bubble of [BLEEP.]<br/> air,
 you're the reason this species
  is a failure,
 and it makes me angry!
  You're drunk.<br/>
  You want to put up a shelf,
 put up a shelf.<br/>
  You want to experience
 true level?
  Do you? Y-yes.<br/>
  Ugh, all right, come on.<br/>
  Wow, it's so
  Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh,
 Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.<br/>
  Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.<br/>
  Morty, come on,
 we're leaving for school.<br/>
  Oh, everything's crooked!
 Reality is poison!
  I want to go back!
 I hate this!
  What's his deal?
 Can't live like this!
  Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty,
 Morty, Morty.<br/>
  Go to school, Summer.<br/>
 I'll go in Morty's memory
  and do a little
  Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!
  Well?
  You seem to be in charge
 of what I get to remember.<br/>
  Why?
  Good question.<br/>
  Morty, I need darkness to prime
 these optical inductors.<br/>
  Hit the leftmost light switch
 by the door for me.<br/>
  The left.<br/>
  Okay, lights on.<br/>
  So, did I just hear three
 distinct light switch clicks?
  W-W-What do you mean?
  I feel like the three sounds
 I heard could be explained
  by an initial erroneous flipping
 of a switch on the right
  followed by a hasty,
 corrective flipping
  of the requested switch.<br/>
  Then during the resultant
 darkness and silence, a third,
  shameful unflipping of
 the initially flipped switch.<br/>
  Is my assessment accurate?
  Yeah, that's that's basically
 how how it all shaked out.<br/>
  I'm sorry.<br/>
  Ugh.<br/>
 All right, come on.<br/>
  What?!
 Come on!
  Grab a shovel.<br/>
  W-What is
  Grab a shovel!
  What was that?
  I can't find a goddamn
 zip tie anywhere!
  All right, [BLEEP.]<br/> it!
  Ahh, zip tie.<br/>
  Why are you making me
 do this for you again?
  Who doesn't wish they could
 talk to animals, Rick?
  Most humans!
  There, I'm done,
 just stay out of trouble!
  Gotta keep moving.<br/>
 Can't stop.<br/>
  Up, down, down, up, up, up,
 down, up, stop, down.<br/>
  The queen needs food.<br/>
 The babies need food.<br/>
  The queen makes babies.<br/>
  The situation in Argentina
  has proven less convenient
 than predicted.<br/>
  We'll have to re-destabilize
 their economy,
  refocus labor class outrage
 from upper to middle,
  foster a coup, and install
 a compliant regime.<br/>
  Same as Guatemala?
  Yes, but you can double time it.<br/>
  We need a quorum
 to pick a new pope,
  in case the Exxon/Monsanto thing
 falls through in Africa.<br/>
  Why not use chemtrails?
 Put a canopy on Uganda.<br/>
  They're set to agitate
 any mo What?
  That kid is watching us.<br/>
  So, we're squirrels, he's a kid.<br/>
  He's watching us like he hears
 what we're saying.<br/>
  Hey, kid.<br/> Young man?
 Come here, little boy.<br/>
  Tell Daphne to run a 199
 on a possible Dolittle.<br/>
  Little boy!
  We'll give you wishes
 if you can hear us!
  We can make you fly
 and get candy.<br/>
  Oh, [BLEEP.]<br/>! Oh, [BLEEP.]<br/>!
 [Bleep.]<br/> me! [Bleep.]<br/> me!
  Rick!
  Ah, [BLEEP.]<br/>, Morty,
 what did you do?
  All right, Morty,
 pack your shit!
  That's only gonna keep 'em down
 for a little bit, Morty!
  You [BLEEP.]<br/> with
 squirrels, Morty!
  We got a good five minutes
  before they're backing up
 on our ass, Morty!
  We have to pack up and move
 to a new reality, Morty!
  You know I said we could
 only do that a couple of times!
  We're [BLEEP.]<br/> over here because
 of these damn squirrels, Morty!
  I don't know what
 my reaction is,
  but I think I'm mounting
 in suspicion of you.<br/>
  - Well, what are you gonna do?
 - I'm gonna remember everything!
  Everything!
  Yeah!
  Ow!
  Ah!
  Ow!
  Well, what'd you find out?
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what
 are you gonna do, kill me?
  No, I'm not gonna kill you.<br/>
 I'm gonna kill myself!
  All those memories just erased!
  Sitting in this room
 collecting dust!
  W-What's the point of going on
 if most of everything
  that happens just ends up
 sitting in here?
  All right, kid.<br/>
  I don't know much aside from
 the fact that ""Men in Black 2""
  is a joyless cash grab, but I do
 know that whatever you have
  brewing around in your noggin
 really connected with you.<br/>
  I can't deny that,
  and I can't deny that I'm
 inspired by your passion.<br/>
  I want in.<br/>
 Suicide pact!
  Yes, yeah, let's do it!
  Together, you old son
 of a bitch! On three!
  One
  Two
  You guys doing
 Morty's Mind Blowers?
  Morty's Mind Blowers?
  Grandpa,
 is this scenario three?
  Uh, w-what's that,
 and w-who are you?
  Oh, man, it's a scenario four.<br/>
  Ugh, [BLEEP.]<br/> goddamn it!
  I don't get paid enough
 for this shit!
  There's a Craftsman nearby.<br/>
 I can smell it.<br/>
  Whoa, what what
  Can I help you?
  H-How did we fall asleep during
 interdimensional cable?
  - Yeah, what the hell, Summer?
 - Summer, you dumb bitch!
  How long were we out,
 you dumb bitch!
  How much interdimensional cable
 did we miss, you stupid bitch!
  How many improv TV shows with
 commercials did we miss, Summer?
  Why did you let us fall asleep?
 You dumb bitch! You stupid bitch!
  All right, Morty,
 [BLEEP.]<br/> this noise.<br/>
  Let's get out of here
 and go on a classic
  Rick and Morty adventure.<br/>
 Yeah, right, Rick, I'm allin.<br/>
  No wonder you're
 constantly fighting
  with each other
 and behind schedule.<br/>
  What?
 Nothing.<br/>
  Rick?
 Hello?
  Just here for my putter.<br/>
  Jerry's Mind Blowers?
  Follow the boys!
  We're charged and aimed
 at Alpha Centauri,
  ready for transport.<br/>
  They fell for it!
 Let's send Gobo home!
  All right!
  - Where's dad?
 - He should be here any second.<br/>
  It's funny, Jerry spent his life
 seeking attention,
  but in the end, humanity's
 instinctive dismissal of him
  saved an alien's life.<br/>
  He knows where to go, right?
  Yep, any minute now.<br/>
  Did it work?
 Did you guys get Gobo home?
  You have Gobo! You were supposed
 to bring him to the hill!
  As if.<br/>
 He was in your basket.<br/>
  He was in your car!
  Oh!
  Oof!
 Dibs on his stuff.<br/>
  Did yoof that?

 News Anchor:
 In local news, child murderer
 Joseph Eli Lipnip
  is scheduled to die tomorrow
 by lethal injection,
  his execution already drawing
 dozens more spectators
  than the death of TV news.<br/>
 Carla?
  Carla Johnson: The man
 that once ate his own son
  Wow.<br/> He's really getting
 executed after all this time.<br/>
  You know the son
 that he ate was --
  Your best friend --
 Tommy.<br/>
  We know.<br/>
 Stop true-crime bragging.<br/>
  I was traumatized,
 Summer.<br/>
  Okay, your generation
 wouldn't get that.<br/>
  Bitch, my generation
  gets traumatized
 for breakfast.<br/>
  It took years of therapy
 to even process the reality.<br/>
  I mean,
 when I was a kid,
  I just told myself
 that Tommy had gotten lost
  in the magical realm
 of Froopyland.<br/>
  ""Froopyland?""
 My make-believe world.<br/>
  I know the name's stupid,
 but it was so real to me.<br/>
  Aren't you guys supposed
 to be at your father's
  for custody weekend?
  We're not in a hurry.<br/>
 Dad sleeps until sundown.<br/>
  Can we talk a little bit more
 about this Froopy--
  [ Zap, bloop .]<br/>
 Summer:
 Not the bubble gun!
  There's no air --
 [ Zap, bloop .]<br/>
  I gotta say, I am warming up
 to the bubble gun.<br/>
  You know, if you're so great
 at naming things,
  why don't you do it
 from now on?
  -What?
 -Froopyland.<br/>
  Was it my best work?
 I don't know.<br/>
  Does it deserve
 to be shit on creatively?
  Yeah, that's right.<br/>
  I agree with your look
 of horrified realization.<br/>
  You can be very inconsiderate
 sometimes.<br/>
  [ Rattling .]<br/>
 [ Grunting .]<br/>
  Here it is.<br/>
  You know, I collapsed
 a quantum tesseract to --
  Dad, I don't care
 how you made it.<br/>
  I want to know if Tommy's
 still in there!
  Relax, Beth.<br/>
 [ Jingling, crackling .]<br/>
  If he is,
 we'll find him.<br/>
  He'll be the only
 sun-bleached skeleton
  with non-imaginary DNA.<br/>
       Tommy!
  Tommy!
  This is a nightmare.<br/>
  I can't believe
 you used to lock me up
  in this glorified
 chicken coop.<br/>
  Chicken coop?
  Those are procedurally
 generated clouds, Beth.<br/>
  That river is a rainbow.<br/>
 Literally.<br/>
  Come on, I-I-I put real
 elbow grease into this place.<br/>
  Well, you're supposed to put
 elbow grease into your daughter!
  Gross.<br/>
  Do you think something ate him?
 Nope.<br/>
  Froopyland creatures
 were designed to be harmless.<br/>
  He definitely
 just starved to death.<br/>
  I could have been the one
 who starved to death in here.<br/>
  What if
 I'd gotten hurt?
  God, you're right.<br/>
 I'm a terrible dad.<br/>
  Well,
 nothing to live for.<br/>
  Goodbye, cruel world!
 Dad!
  [ Thump .]<br/>
 Oh, how do you like that?
  What kind of merciless creator
 makes the ground bouncy?
  I'm gonna have
 to drown myself.<br/>
  [ Thump .]<br/>
 Unh!
  Oh, no.<br/>
 Oh, the water's breathable?
  Who went and did that?
  Oh, whatever.<br/>
  Yeah, whatever.<br/>
  A dad makes a toilet
 look like R2-D2,

 looking for are -- Aah!

 Holy [bleep.]<br/>
 [Bleep.]<br/> This thing has claws!
  Yeah, I get it.<br/>
 It's a childproof world.<br/>
  No, no, seriously,
 this hurts really bad!
  This thing is sinking
 razor-sharp claws in --

  [ Pop, pop .]<br/>
  Ugh!
 [ Both panting .]<br/>

 [ Door opens .]<br/>
  Bienvenue a la

  Wow, Dad.<br/>
  Your place looks way less
 like a crackhouse.<br/>
  It's actually clean,
 like a cocaine house.<br/>

 what's going on?
  I'm simply centered,
 activated --
  [ Glass clinks .]<br/>
 [ Warble .]<br/>
  And telekinetic?
  Pretty cool,
 huh?
  Check it out.<br/>
 Who wants a smoothie?
  [ Rattle .]<br/>
  [ Blender whirring .]<br/>
  Oh -- Oh, no.<br/>
 Uh, oh, God.<br/>
  Summer -- Summer,
 can you --
  -Aah!
 -Sorry.<br/>
  [ Warble .]<br/>
 You have much to learn,
 my Uloo.<br/>
  Morty, Summer,
 this is Kiara.<br/>
  She's a Krootabulan
 warrior priestess
  from Krootabulon.<br/>
  I-I know where Krootabulans
 are from, Dad.<br/>
  Uh, Chaimuntolo.<br/>
  Chaimuntolo,
 younglings.<br/>
  Hymencholo.<br/>
  Your father's mind
 holds love for you.<br/>
  I am humbled to meet
 in physicality.<br/>
  Dad, are you --
  In love with a badass,
 sexy alien lady?
  Ha, ha, I don't know, Summer.<br/>
 You tell me.<br/>
  I wasn't going to ask
 if you were in love
  since you barely
 know her.<br/>
  Summer.<br/>
  Kiara and I met on that
 interstellar dating service
  Rick was
 always suggesting
  when your mom and I
 were together.<br/>
  And things just
 kind of clicked.<br/>
  We must move!
  Our reservation
 is at 7:00.<br/>
  [ Whoosh .]<br/>
 I hate
 to see her leave,
  but I love to watch
 her phase shift away.<br/>
  I'm sure you noticed
 what she has three of,
  but guess what
 she has two of?
  [ Screeches .]<br/>
  Oof!
  All right,
 knock it off!
  Listen, I've been
 giving you a pass
  because I'm charmed
 that life finds a way, but --
  Aah!
 All right, you know what?
  [ Ray gun fires .]<br/>
 Ouch!
  Oh!
 Unh!
  Ouch!
 God!
  [ Sizzling .]<br/>
 Aah!
  Agh!
  [ Arm clicks .]<br/>
  Oh, Dad, this place
 is the safest.<br/>
  Best dad ever.<br/>
  Can't you just say,
 ""I admit it, I screwed up""?
  Uh, what would be
 the point of that?
  [ Chuckling .]<br/>
 You can't do it, can you?
  You can't just
 [bleep.]<br/> apologize.<br/>
  Okay, okay,
 Beth, I'm sorry
  you think you deserve
 an apology.<br/>
  [ Screeches .]<br/>
 Hey,
 don't look at me.<br/>
  You let your kid roll around
 on the floor of a target,
  it's gonna
 get stepped on.<br/>
  [ Screeches .]<br/>
  [ Whir, zap .]<br/>
  Huh.<br/> Well, here's the problem
 right here.<br/>
  We've got a bunch of
 Froopyland procedural carbons
  all gummed up and mixed in
 with real human DNA.<br/>
  Are you saying
 Tommy survived here
  by having sex
 with Froopy creatures,
  creating Froopy-human
 hybrid offspring,
  and then consuming
 their proteins,
  sustaining himself with
 an endless cycle of
 cannibalistic incest?
  It's just
 a working theory.<br/>
  Of course,
 if that's the case,
  I expect he'd be worshiped
 as a kind of god
  by a medieval-level
 society
  of his least-delicious
 children.<br/>
  Halt!
  You are now prisoners
 of our exalted ruler,
  giver and taker
 of life,
  helper and consumer
 of mortality,
  dispenser of life --
 Yes,
 if I could interrupt?
  We're way ahead
 of the reveal here.<br/>
  Yeah, just take us
 to King Tommy.<br/>
  I thought
 warrior priestesses
  could only leave Krootabulon
 on a hunt.<br/>
  Mmm.<br/>
 Thank you, sweetie.<br/>
  I hope it's not
 human season.<br/>
  I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix.<br/>
 I would never hunt a human.<br/>
  Your father and I
 are soul-bonded.<br/>
  Soul-bonded?
  Um, does your planet
 have shorter days,
  because you guys are moving
 kind of fast, no?
  [ Sniffing .]<br/>
  [ Dramatic music plays .]<br/>
  [ Whoosh .]<br/>
  Go get him, honey!
  She's always hunting.<br/>
 [ Chuckles .]<br/>
  She probably knew
 a Varrix worked here,
  and that's why she said
 the Yelp reviews didn't matter.<br/>
  Dad, do you understand
  how serious
 Krootabulon soul-bonding is?
  Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know.<br/>
 It's got such a casual name.<br/>
  If you want to lecture anyone
 about commitment,
  start with your mom.<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/>
 Dad, is that what this is about?
  Are you rushing into a new thing
 to get back at Mom?
  Every weekend, you two
 have told me to move on.<br/>
  Move on, like,
 out of bed.<br/>
  Like, stop using paper towels
 for toilet paper,
  not move on
 into a sloppy rebound.<br/>
  Dad, you need to slow down,
 rethink this soul bond.<br/>
  Why don't you just say
 what you really mean?
  You think it's cool
  that having sex with her
 gives me telekinesis
  and you recognize
 she's got a hot bod
  like Cheetara
 in ""Thundercats,""
  but you're grossed out
  by her avocado-shaped head
 and blue skin,
  and you think I want to put
 a bag and a wig on her head.<br/>
  After all the time
 and energy I spent
  teaching you two
 about race
  [ Varrix screams .]<br/>
 you ended up racist.<br/>
  [ Whoosh .]<br/>
  Soon your world
 will be rid of Varrix.<br/>
  Tomorrow,
 we celebrate.<br/>
  We could take the kids
 to the water park.<br/>
  We celebrate
 with a hunt!
  Ooh.<br/>
 You kids want to hunt?
  -Yes.<br/>
 -Yes.<br/>
  [ Trumpet fanfare .]<br/>
  All kneel
 for King Tommy!
  I'm not kneeling.<br/>
 Suck my [bleep.]<br/>
  Well, hello, all!
  I am the King
 of Froopyland,
  but I go
 by another name, too.<br/>
  We know.<br/>
 It's Tommy!
  -We know.<br/>
 -We know.<br/>
  I have lived here
 since I was a mere child.<br/>
  -We know.<br/>
 -Got it.<br/>
  I suppose
 you're wondering,
  how do I
 sustain myself?
  -Oh, boy.<br/>
 -No, we aren't.<br/>
  I always find
 the theater
  is the best way
 to clarify things.<br/>
  -Ugh.<br/>
 -Seriously?
  Oh, my God.<br/>
 Players, go!
  I am little Tommy.<br/>
  [ Crowd cheers .]<br/>
  I am tiny Beth.<br/>
  [ Crowd boos .]<br/>
  Oh, come on.<br/>
  Come with me
 to a magic land.<br/>
  Froopy: Don't do it!
  This is
 my secret Froopyland
  where I have no rules!
  I am excited.<br/>
  I am jealous of Tommy's friends
 and his Nintendo
  and his dad
 who likes him.<br/>
  I take it Tommy wasn't
 class playwright.<br/>
  You want to see
 the Honey Swamp?
  Yes!
 Let's do it!
  Well,
 I want to see you dead.<br/>
  Ow, help!
 I'm stuck!
  I'm covered in honey.<br/>
  Huh.<br/>
 Well, that's interesting.<br/>
  Fake news.<br/>
  Many nights have passed,
  trapped
 in this strange land.<br/>
  I am hungry, and all I can do
 to pass the time is hump.<br/>
  I will hump this rock.<br/>
  [ Tapping .]<br/>
  I will hump this tree.<br/>
  [ Tapping .]<br/>
  I will hump
 this beast of the land
  and put my seed in it.<br/>
  [ Tapping .]<br/>
  I am the first
 of Tommy's children.<br/>
  Eat of my flesh
 so you may survive.<br/>
  And so I did.<br/>
  Oh, wow.<br/>
  Okay.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
  Certified fresh.<br/>
 Good -- Good job.<br/>
  Perhaps a demonstration is
 in order.<br/> [ Unzips shorts .]<br/>
  No, that is the last thing
 that is in order!
 Ugh.<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/>
 Poor Froopy character.<br/>
  Leave him alone.<br/>
 [ Shorts zip .]<br/>
  Ahh.<br/>
 Gather round, gang!
 [ Moos .]<br/>
  Dinner time.<br/>
  [ Splorch .]<br/>
  All right, that's it.<br/>
 I'm outta here.<br/>
  What are you doing?
  We're in the middle
 of an adventure.<br/>
  Here's some things
 an adventure needs, Beth.<br/>
  Conflict, stakes,
 a way for me to benefit,
  and, clearly, Morty.<br/>
  But Tommy's
 still in there,
  raping Muppets
 and eating babies.<br/>
  Yep.<br/> Luckily,
 that's not our problem.<br/>
  Time to pull the plug.<br/>
  Pull the plug?
  We have to get Tommy
 out of there, okay?
  We -- We need to do
 the right thing.<br/>
  Do what you never did
 as a dad --
  Put in a little effort.<br/>
  All right,
 cut the high-road routine.<br/>
  We both saw
 Tommy's shitty play.<br/>
  You pushed him
 in the Honey Swamp, Beth.<br/>
  His very happy life
 is in your hands.<br/>
  You go save him
 from it.<br/>
  [ Scoffs .]<br/> You're gonna believe
 a play over your own daughter?
  Yes, I am, Beth,
 because you're not
 my own daughter.<br/>
  Oh, God, yes.<br/>
  I'm one of infinite Beths
  with infinite fathers
 in infinite universes.<br/>
  It's called a hug, Dad.<br/>
 It won't kill you.<br/>
  Yeah, don't be so sure.<br/>
  You know why all Ricks
 made a Froopyland
  for all their
 little girls?
  Same reason
 I wasn't surprised
  by Tommy's overwritten,
 badly structured,
  cheaply produced
 flashback.<br/>
  You were a scary [bleep.]<br/> kid,
 man.<br/>
  [ Scoffing .]<br/>
 Oh, my God.<br/>
  I didn't make Froopyland
 to get rid of you, Beth.<br/>
  I did it to protect
 the neighborhood.<br/>
  Not in a [burps.]<br/>
 noble sense.<br/>
  It was just more practical
 to sequester you
  before I had to start,
 you know, cloning a replacement
  for every less-than-polite
 little boy or gullible animal
  that might cross
 your socio-path.<br/>
  You would rather believe
 I'm evil
  than admit that
 you were a bad father?
  Oh, dude, no.<br/>
  No, bad father all the way
 to the max over here.<br/>
  I'm a [bleep.]<br/> nutcase.<br/>
  And the acorn plopped
 straight down, baby.<br/>
  Look at
 some of this shit
  you were asking me
 to make you as a kid.<br/>
  Ray guns.<br/>
  A whip that forces people
 to like you.<br/>
  Invisibility cuffs,
 a parent trap, a lightning gun,
  a teddy bear with
 anatomically correct innards,
  night-vision googly-eye glasses,
 sound-erasing sneakers,
  false fingerprints,
 fall-asleep darts,
  a lie-detecting doll,
 an indestructible baseball bat,
  a Taser shaped like a ladybug,
 a fake police badge,
  location-tracking stickers,
 rainbow-colored duct tape,
  mind-control hair clips,
 poison gum,
  a pink,
 sentient switchblade.<br/>
  Hi, Beth,
 you've gotten taller.<br/>
  Shall we resume
 stabbing?
  Has it occurred to you
  that I asked you
 to make those things
  because I wanted you
 to spend time with me?
  Has it occurred to you that
 if I did try killing Tommy,
  it might be because
 I was jealous of his family?
  Wait, what?
 Why?
  Wasn't his dad, like,
 some kind of cannibal?
  Seems like it must be
 hereditary.<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/>
 This is your fault.<br/>
  I am not a bad person.<br/>
  I'm gonna go back
 in there,
  I'm getting Tommy,
 and I'm fixing this!
  Whatever you say,
 Stone Cold Steve Austin.<br/>
 [ Jingling .]<br/>
  I don't know why
 I just said that.<br/>
  Doesn't make a lot of sense,
 but gotta stand by it.<br/>
  Whatever you say,
 Stone Cold Steve Austin.<br/>
  I'm owning it.<br/>
  [ Ax swings .]<br/>
  Morty: No, Dad!
 You're not doing it right!
 [ Ax swings .]<br/>
  Cutting off their heads
 isn't doing it right?
  They're [grunts.]<br/>
 clearly regenerative!
  I-I think you have to stab them
 through the heart or something.<br/>
  You think or you know?
  I thought you were the alien
 expert, Isaac Asi-hole.<br/>
  Don't snap at me!
 I'm tired!
  -Me, too!
 -We're all tired!
  [ Ax swings .]<br/>
  [ Whoosh .]<br/>
 [ Grunts .]<br/>
  That's
 the last of them.<br/>
  Tonight,
 we celebrate.<br/>
  With a hunt?
  Yes, for tomorrow,
 we hunt.<br/>
  [ Rain trickling .]<br/>
 [ Clears throat .]<br/>
  I, uh, really have to get out
 of this soul bond.<br/>
  -What the [bleep.]<br/> Dad?
 -Oh, my God! Duh!
  -Obviously!
 -Yeah, no kidding!
  Can you guys help me?
  What? How?
  Can I just, uh, tell her
 it's because of my kids?
  You know, like, you don't like
 the shape of her head, or --
  That's you, Dad!
 That's you!
  You're a baby
 and an idiot!
  I think that's been established,
 Summer.<br/> Now help me!
  First,
 I want you to admit
  that you're a closet racist,
 a beta-male sexist,
  and you dragged everyone
 into a horrible situation
  by only thinking
 of yourself.<br/>
  Okay.<br/>
  I want
 to hear you say it.<br/>
  [ Sighs deeply .]<br/>
  Look,
 I'm a closeted racist,
  and I'm sexist
 and selfish,
  and I dragged us all into
 my sexist, racist bad things
  because I'm stupid.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
  Now you're gonna help me,
 right?
 She just did.<br/>
  Yeah,
 clean up your own mess.<br/>
  Wait, wait, what?
  Oh, man.<br/>
  [ Trumpet fanfare .]<br/>
 Tommy: All right, everybody.<br/>
  Next item
 on the docket --
  I would like to have sex
 with some of you,
  and then eat the babies.<br/>
 [ Froopys murmuring .]<br/>
  I thought
 you'd like that.<br/>
  I do keep rolling out
 the hits, don't I?
  [ Bang .]<br/>
  Oh!
 It's the Magic Crayon Lady!
  Are you hungry?
 I was just about to make dinner.<br/>
  And by ""make dinner,""
 I mean --
  Tommy, I'm going to take you
 to the real world.<br/>
  Well, this is
 the real world.<br/>
  No, you don't understand!
 Your dad --
  Uh, people think
 your dad ate you!
  So?
 You doy-oy!
  People should
 eat people.<br/>
  Just leave me alone!
  Tommy,
 you don't understand.<br/>
  I have to make this right
  because it's my fault
 that you're in here.<br/>
  I'm Beth.<br/>
 [ All gasp .]<br/>
  -Beth?
 -The destroyer!
  The destroyer!
  Oh, suck it up,
 Princess Incest.<br/>
  You fell
 into some honey.<br/>
  Well, it tends to happen
 when one is pushed into honey.<br/>
  I respect your right
 to believe I pushed you.<br/>
  Oh, do I get
 to have that?
  Is my reality like
 a little side of fries --
  a little Kwanzaa
 you're willing to slide my way?
  Yes, because I'm focused
 on saving your father's life
  because I'm not
 a petty piece of [bleep.]<br/>
  So, then,
 it should be pretty easy
  to say,
 ""Sorry I pushed you.<br/>""
  Real easy
 and not necessary,
  since you coming home
 will save your dad's life
  whereas nothing is changed
  by anyone stroking
 your batshit-crazy ego.<br/>
  Sorry, forgive me.<br/>
  Uh, I've been in Froopyland
 for quite a while.<br/>
  Have apologies changed?
  Tommy, I'm sorry you think
 you deserve an apology.<br/>
  Oh, my God.<br/>
 I'm my father.<br/>
  Uh, will someone
 just kill this B-word?
  [ Froopys muttering
 threateningly .]<br/>
  [ Grunts .]<br/>
 Hi-ya!
  Oh, my God.<br/>
 I'm my father!
  Ya!
 Ooh! Froopy!
  [ Screams .]<br/>
  Switchblade:
 It's stab time!
 Together: Ooh!
  [ School bell rings .]<br/>
  And that's why one pussy
 plus two pussies
  makes a bunch of pussies.<br/>
  Come on, y'all,
 I'm trying to make this
  appealing to your
 sex-addicted lifestyles.<br/>
  Hi, I need to pull Morty out of
 school.<br/> Come on, Morty.<br/>
  Ha! You heard
 your daddy, Morty.<br/>
  you have
 to leave school.<br/>
  Wait,
 what are my values?
  Dad, what's going on?
 We're going to Alaska.<br/>
  What? Why?
 It's nice there.<br/>
  Also, I broke up with Kiara,
 and she didn't take it well,
  and she wants
 to murder you two.<br/>
  What? Th-Then why
 are we walking?
  I'm walking
 because I'm tired.<br/>
  You guys should
 definitely run.<br/>
  [ Whoosh .]<br/>
 [ Screams .]<br/>
  [ Thud .]<br/>
 Excuse me, I just --
  You know what?
 I'm -- I'm just gonna go left.<br/>
  No, okay, your left,
 that's fine.<br/>
  Do you know what left is,
 'cause -- Ugh!
  What does your breakup
 have to do with us?
 [ Engine starts .]<br/>
  Yeah,
 we chose Mom hands down.<br/>
  I thought we made that clear
 at the lawyer's office
  and in the comments under
 your weird rant on Facebook.<br/>
  [ Crash .]<br/>
 [ Tires squeal .]<br/>
  She kind of blames you guys
 for the breakup.<br/>
  -Why?
 -Why?
  Because I told her
 it was your fault.<br/>
  -What?!
 -What?!
  Look,
 I'm not an evil person.<br/>
  I'm just not
 very imaginative!
  [ Warbling .]<br/>
  [ Grunts .]<br/>
 [ Metal twisting .]<br/>
  Oh!
  [ All scream .]<br/>
  Rick:
 Doo-doo butt
  Doo-doo-doo -- doo-doo butt
  No.<br/>
 [ Jingling .]<br/>
  Doo-doo butt,
 doo-doo butt 
  Hey.<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
  Um, hmm, so just, like,
 out of curiosity,
  if you were gonna make
 a clone of Tommy,
  what would you need
 to get started?
  I don't kn--
 Tommy's DNA?
  Okay,
 'cause he, um
  Yeah, he didn't
 want to come back,
  so, um,
 he gave me this.<br/>
  He gave you his finger?
  Uh, well,
 what happened is --
  It's okay.<br/>
 It doesn't matter.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
  This'll take
 about three hours.<br/>
  Okay.<br/>
  Hey.<br/>
 You want to help?
  Okay.<br/>
  Doo
 I got a doo-doo in my butt 
  Doo-doo-doo-doo
 And I don't know what to do 
  With the doo-doo in my butt 
  But I know that a father
 should say to you 
  That he's proud of you 
  Doo 
 Every daughter is a doo-doo
 from a father's butt 
  Biologically speaking,
 the butt is a nut 
  And every father
 fathers wrong 
  Ooh 
 And there isn't a song 
  That can change that 
  I am wiped out.<br/>
 I guess I'll turn in.<br/>
  Cool.<br/>
  Dad?
  I feel like
 I've spent my life
  pretending you're a great guy
 and trying to be like you.<br/>
  And the ugly truth
 has always been --
  That I'm not that great a guy
 and you're exactly like me.<br/>
  Am I evil?
  Worse.<br/>
 You're smart.<br/>
  When you know nothing matters,
 the universe is yours.<br/>
  And I've never met a universe
 that was into it.<br/>
  The universe is
 basically an animal.<br/>
  It grazes
 on the ordinary.<br/>
  It creates infinite idiots
 just to eat them,
  not unlike
 your friend Timmy.<br/>
 Tommy.<br/>
  Yeah, it hardly matters now,
 sweetie.<br/>
  You know, smart people get
 a chance to climb on top,
  take reality for a ride,
  but it'll never stop
 trying to throw you.<br/>
  And, eventually,
 it will.<br/>
  There's no
 other way off.<br/>
  Dad, I'm out of excuses
 to not be who I am.<br/>
  So who am I?
 What do I do?
  My advice --
 Take off.<br/>
  Put a saddle on your universe.<br/>
 Let it kick itself out.<br/>
  I can't do that.<br/>
  The kids,
 Jerry, my job,
  and, as much as I hate to admit
 it, ABC's ""The Bachelor.<br/>""
  I can make a clone of you,
 a perfect instance of you,
  with all your memories.<br/>
  An exact copy
 in every way.<br/>
  It'll love and provide
 for the kids,
  do your job, and consume
 broadcast-network reality TV
  on the same allegedly ironic
 level as you.<br/>
  You could be gone a day,
 a week,
  or the rest of your life
 with zero consequences.<br/>
  The moment you decide
 to come back,
  I flip a switch,
 and the clone's job is done.<br/>
  It feels no pain,
 it regrets nothing,
  and has zero chance
 of going ""Blade Runner.<br/>""
  If nothing matters,
 why would you do that for me?
  I don't know, maybe you matter
 so little that I like you.<br/>
  Or maybe
 it makes you matter.<br/>
  Maybe I love you.<br/>
  Maybe something about
 your mother.<br/>
  Don't jump a gift shark
 in the mouth.<br/>
  I don't know
 if I can do it.<br/>
  Then stay,
 and luxuriate in a life
  you can finally know
 you've chosen.<br/>
  My secret bonus is that
 no matter what you choose,
  you're finally gonna
 chill the [bleep.]<br/> out.<br/>
  Okay.<br/>
  I know
 what I want to do.<br/>
  [ Whoosh .]<br/>
  Aah!
  [ Thud .]<br/>
 Ow!
  You can't run forever!
  She's really pissed off.<br/>
  I know.<br/>
 It's kinda hot.<br/>
  Shut up!
  The hunters!
 They're back! Run!
  -We're not hunters.<br/>
 -We want to hide with you.<br/>
  We're not hiding.<br/>
 We're nesting.<br/>
  Ooh la la.<br/>
  [ All scream .]<br/>
  The children
 must be destroyed
  so that
 we can be together.<br/>
  You need to break up with her,
 Dad -- properly!
  [ Whoosh .]<br/>
 God damn it, Dad!
  [ Grunts .]<br/>
 Dump her!
  Okay, okay.<br/>
  Kiara,
 let's just run away.<br/>
  -Dad!
 -Come on!
  Just rip
 the Band-Aid off!
  Okay!
  Kiara, when I told you
 my kids were bigoted racists
  who were demanding
 I break up with you,
  I lied.<br/>
  If anybody deserves to be
 telekinetically strangled,
  it's me.<br/>
  I'm the one who
 wants to break up.<br/>
  I -- I'm not
 an evil person.<br/>
  I'm lazy,
 I'm cowardly,
  and -- and I do not
 know what I'm doing.<br/>
  Look, I got someone pregnant
 at 17.<br/>
  We're getting a divorce.<br/>
 None of this is on purpose.<br/>
  I was excited
 to date someone cool
  because it would make
 my ex notice me.<br/>
  I would expect nothing less
 from humanity --
  a selfish, manipulative,
 dishonest species that --
  -Kiara?
 -Trandor!
  What are you
 doing here?
  Justhunting.<br/>
  Do you really expect me
 to believe
  it has nothing to do
 with us?
  You knew
 Earth was my domain.<br/>
  I don't like what
 you're insinuating.<br/>
  Dad, can we go now?
 Hold on a second.<br/>
  I'm starting to get the feeling
 that I was the rebound.<br/>
  Dad, you just got handed
 an Ex Machina.<br/>
  You're taking it.<br/>
  Varrix nests spread
 across 300 galaxies,
  and you just happened to pick
 this planet to hunt?
  That's Gorgon shit --
 total Gorgon shit!
  [ Birds chirping .]<br/>
  We're home!
  Hey, guys!
 What's for dinner?
  How was Jerry's?
 The usual.<br/>
  Can we have pizza?
 Pizza sounds great.<br/>
  Hey, Rick, did you know my dad
 was dating an alien?
  No.<br/> Gross.<br/>
 For the alien.<br/>
  Aw, crap, I think
 Arnaldo's is closed.<br/>
  Are you guys sure
 you want pizza?
  [ Whoosh .]<br/>
  Arnaldo's isn't closed
 in the dimension
  where they didn't invent
 Daylight Savings!
  What would we do without you?
 I love you, Dad.<br/>
  Love you, too,
 sweetie.<br/>
  By the way,
 that wasn't time travel.<br/>
  There were just a couple pizzas
 on the counter.<br/>
  I grabbed them.<br/>
            [ Beep .]<br/>
 Hey, Jerry, it's Kiara.<br/>
  Listen, my boyfriend saw those
 texts you've been sending me,
  and he got pretty pissed off.<br/>
  If he calls you,
 just ignore him!
 [ Beep .]<br/>
  [ Beep .]<br/>
 This is Carmox.<br/>
  I have intercepted
 sexual communications
  between you and my
 new girlfriend, Kiara.<br/>
  I am coming to kill you now!
 [ Beep .]<br/>
  [ Beep .]<br/>
 Rick:
 Yo, Jerry, it's the Big R.<br/>
  Uh, I killed that alien
 that was coming after ya.<br/>
  Looking out for ya, buddy.<br/>
 [ Beep .]<br/>
  [ Beep .]<br/>
 Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.<br/>
  Don't be mad.<br/> I [bleep.]<br/>
 your ex-girlfriend Kiara.<br/>
  Kiara: Who are you
 talking to, Rick?
  Doesn't matter.<br/>
 [ Beep .]<br/>
  [ Beep .]<br/>
 Hey, Jerry, this is Michael
  down at The Antique Phone
 rentals.<br/>
  Um, I'm gonna go ahead
 and let you off the hook
  for the $70 late fee.<br/>
  You can go ahead and keep
 that answering machine.<br/>
  Nobody really
 uses those anymore
  except for exposition
 on TV shows, anyways.
